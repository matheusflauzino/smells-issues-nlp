But currently when you exclude an app (an app launcher) everything that comes with that app (the other launch icons) will be hidden too. And that's not really what one would expect.

For example, the [xkcd browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floern.xkcd) app has two launchers: one for xkcd comic and the other for What If. I don't use the What If launcher very often, as it does not update so frequently and because I like to get rid of unnecessary things and keep only the minimum (so that's why I use KISS) so I try to hide/exclude What If launcher. But that results in hiding the other launcher too, which is not what I wanted to do.

So if we have a feature to hide specific icons instead of excluding everything that comes with an app (are the widgets included?) would be much appreciated. Thanks."

Although it did work, it went against the documentation from most search engines, that specified a URL with the more standard `%s` used by browsers.

Going forward, adding a new provider will require to use %s.

Neamar/KISS,open,,Gray out or hide work profile icons when work profile is turned off,[],0,"Love the launcher, it's been at the center of my phone for over a year now.

When work profile is turned off (through the top pull-down menu thing), clicking on icons produces an error, asking you if you want to turn on a work profile (as it should).

Having a visual indicator of work profile being turned off in KISS by graying out the icons would be very useful (default Pixel Launcher does that, so it's likely there's a built-in way to do this).

An alternative would be to hide the work profile icons when work profile is turned off."

I hope you can fix it quick because stock vanilla boring is starting to hurt my eyes?

My observation and feature request is... could the clutterfree screen be used as a paste board for links to files, shortcuts for items of interest?? the widgets (beta) seemed a step in this direction but personally the search bar covers this requirement from my point of view. A pasteboard for stuff  I can't find through the search bar is what I would really find useful.

I am no coder but i recognise the true benefits KISS offers, but believe this could enhance the productivity further by using the screen to store and access info the search bar can't find ... I'm thinking like an old pc desktop screen...an untidy but visual snap shot of what's to do next... clear the desk when new stuff comes in. Old skool - but if made simple to use with a share command; very useful... KISS for me as always been about no distractions and getting the job done. This  enhancement embraces that ethos -  search bar for the tools , screen for the materials... for  want of a better metaphor.

The overall interface becomes unusable, the lists flickers while the icons are blank, the favourites can't be launched.

# Possible cause
Kiss started to behave weirdly after the following scenario have been followed:

* Received a vCard by SMS into Signal sent from an iPhone 11.3;
* Called the number shown in the vCard data by clicking on the hyper-link in the message;
* Finished the call;
* Hit the «Home Button» to get back to Kiss which behaves normally;
* Opened the phone app again;
* Started to create a new entry in the address book for the number;
* Closed the new entry to check if the contact already exists;
* Selected «add to existing contact»;
* Browsed to the entry and selected the entry for the mobile phone;
* Saved and hit home to get back to Kiss which immediately started to behave weirdly;
* No error message is showing.

# Failed attempts to solve the problem
* Rebooting the phone;
* Changing the default launcher to the stock one and then back to Kiss;
* Removing the screen protection;
* Thoroughly cleaning the screen;
* Cleaning the memory and processes.


# Circumventing the problem
* Unselecting the contacts option in the Data Source menu in Kiss' parameters makes it behaves normally again;
* Reselecting this entry puts Kiss back in an unstable status;

# Next steps

I'm waiting for your feedback, in the case you'd like to have a log trace in buggish state.

* Deleting the entry;
* Purging Kiss history;
* Uninstalling Kiss to install it back.

# Context

* app version : Kiss 3.2.0 from F-Droid repo
* android version: 8.0.0 on EMUI 8.0.0 published by Huawei, no kernel mods (i.e. root…)

Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-06-19 11:02:26,[DNM] Reporting of settings in use for KISS beta,[],0,"**tl;dr**: the beta version of KISS will monitor a couple of metrics over the coming weeks, to provide opportunities to remove unused features, improve the onboarding experience by settings sensible defaults, and allow the developers to focus on the features most in-use.

## I'm not in the beta / I use f-droid, what is changing for me?
Nothing. KISS will not have access to the internet. Your data will stay on your device forever :heart: 

## I'm in the beta, can you start with why?!
Everyone hates tracking, and that includes me and the other KISS developers. 
Our [privacy policy is super clear](https://kisslauncher.com/privacy): the default version of KISS does not have access to the Internet, and your data is your data. Period.

However, with time, we've noticed that we had no visibility over which features were used, and which weren't. This led to slow development ([just look at everything that has to be tested for a release!](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/blob/master/qa-suite.md)) and user frustration when we were unable to assess the real impact of a missing feature or bug.

To solve that, I'm starting an audit of the settings currently being used by the beta users on the Play Store ([want to join the beta?](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/fr.neamar.kiss)).

For the next couple of weeks, the beta version will report the settings currently enabled and a couple of metrics described below.

**If you do not want to be tracked, that's obviously perfectly fine and understandable! Just [opt-out of the beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/fr.neamar.kiss) to get the standard, internet-less KISS.**

## What is tracked?
If you want to get a complete list, you should check the changes [here](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/pull/979/files), but here is the high-level recap of the events:

* Time to load KISS (includes the *number* of apps and contacts, to normalize the data; of course, no actual apps or contacts are sent)
* Time to load search results (include the *length* of the query, of course, no text query is sent)
* Click on a result (includes the type of result being clicked [app? contact? shortcut?], and the relevance of the result [score]. Of course the name of the result is never sent)
* Click on a favorite (includes the type of the favorite [app? contact?] and the favorite position (from 1 to 6)
* All apps button clicked

In addition to those events, the following properties are aggregated with a random user-id:

* device model
* Android version
* app version
* approximate geolocation (country)
* Locale being used (to improve translation effort)
* value for each boolean settings (e.g. ""rounded bar enabled"")
* value for each setting not containing user information (for instance, your search providers settings are not sent) (e.g. ""theme being used"")

## Who will have access to the data?
For now, that's only me.
The data will likely be shared with long-term developers on a need-to-know basis; this will probably include @sandoche @saveman71 @psykzz @TBog @licaon-kter.
Data will never be shared outside of those individuals, or sold, or anything. It will only be used to inform future developments.
Data is stored in Amplitude's server, more info about their privacy and security [here](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206533238-Data-Security-Privacy).

Keep in mind that we all care about KISS. I've worked on this project for nearly 10 years, and I'm just trying to make it better. I have a job outside and don't need any money or rubbish ""you're not the customer you're the product"" mentality. I do *care* about this and will fight to the end to make sure this data is used (and discarded after use) correctly.

## I have more questions!
I understand this is a tricky topic, if you have any additional question or concern please send an email to contact@kisslauncher.com or even better, comment on this PR.

## Uh, I'm a dev and this is a very unusual PR!
Yup, I've hijacked the description field to add more info about this.
Feel free to review the PR, but *do not merge* it!"

1) When tapping the screen to show history, the only way to back out of the history without clicking on an icon is to hit the Android Home or Back button.

2) Even if you press in a blank area on the history screen you end up selecting an app to open.

3) It would be nice if there was a default or an option to select to enable a zone about 20% of the right side of the screen where if you tap the blank area the history disappears to show you the main screen again, as if you hit the Home or Back button. 

4) So, tap screen to show history, tap right side 20% of screen to make the history disappear again without hitting Home or Back Button.

**5) Not sure if this should be a separate issue, but it could possibly make more sense to put the ""Show history on touch"" setting in ""History settings"" instead of ""User experience"" settings.**

Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-04-02 20:29:10,Improvements on load time,[],0,"Recently, we spent a bunch of time optimizing search.

But hey, another big area of KISS is startup time. For most of us, we only see it once when we boot the device, but on some devices with low memory (or for gamers), the loading happens more frequently and can benefit from some optimizations.

## Overview
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178248-8f5757d2-3606-11e8-9ea0-caab71ddb6be.png)

AsyncTask#1 is the app loader,
AsyncTask#2 is the contact loader.

(might be interesting to try to make those calls in parallel to use multi-core when available, but that's something Android does on its own)

## Flamegraph: app loading
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178252-99ba632c-3606-11e8-97f8-38b38dbc8210.png)

A lot of time spent on system calls, not much to optimize here.
Notice the `normalizeWithResults` function, not a big drain but still here.

## Flamegraph: contact loading
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178258-c41c38f2-3606-11e8-83a3-c2c85c51fa07.png)

And with details:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178259-c8d96842-3606-11e8-8bee-8ab5e669e150.png)

A bunch of things that got optimized here:

* No more regexp in `PhoneNormalizer`. Regexps are slow, and in this case, we don't need them. (from 9% to 2.7%)
* We had two different simplifying regexp, for no reason. Phone uniqueness is now defined with the `simplifiedPhoneNumber`. (from 4.3% to 0%)

Notice the `normalizeWithResults` function, which accounts for 47% of the time.

## Flamegraph: `normalizeWithResults()`
As noticed before, this function gets called a lot by both AppLoader and ContactLoader.

Here is a zoom on the flamegraph:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178635-dc0155f8-360e-11e8-8496-421574dcbd88.png)

Actual numbers:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38178637-e4f98234-360e-11e8-9fec-9d7518db71fa.png)

The call to denormalize on NFKD is the most expensive one by far.

However, in most situations, we can assume that 80%+ of the characters will be basic latin characters (ASCII code < 'z'). So I've introduced a small `if` that short-circuit the normalizer whenever we're dealing with a basic Latin character (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).

The Normalizer is not an easy-to-understand piece of code, and Unicode is really tricky for me, so I wasn't able to come up with anything more than that. It did, however, move the needle, as for ContactLoader `setName()` went from 47% of the time spent loading to 22%. The impact on AppLoader is less important as most of the time is still spent in system calls anyway.

----
**TL;DR**: contact load time improved by roughly 20%, app load time improved by roughly 5%."
Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-03-31 18:39:18,Removed reflection code,[],0,"The reflection code was here to hide the triangular overlay displayed by default on the contact badge:

However, reflection is now disabled in Android P.

Since Android L, there is an open API to hide the triangular area, so we'll just use it, and devices pre-L will see the triangle :(

Fix #941."

```"
Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-05-12 10:32:13,Improve search algorithm / minimize GC stress,"[Label(name=""performance"")]",0,"We've been discussing with @saveman71 to improve the search performance.

Right now, based on the flame graphs, we spend a lot of time allocating memory for storing positions:

https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/blob/93367fcfceff8b7c524adde33d5f369422443389/app/src/main/java/fr/neamar/kiss/utils/FuzzyScore.java#L148-L154

In addition to this, every single Pojo in the app stores an ArrayList. If you have 5k contacts, that's 5k array lists created *for each search*, and 5k array lists *stored forever* (forever because KISS is never closed). OK, they're empty, but still, that's a lot.

The plan is to split the current algorithm into two independent parts:

* compute relevance, without storing the positions. This algorithm will run on every query and needs to be fast (and ideally, should make the garbage collector happy)
* compute highlighting, which we can delay until we're actually planning to display the results.

So, right now, when you search on your 1k contacts for the letter ""a"", assuming 700 contains the letter ""a"", we:

* go through 1000 items,
* generate 1000 array lists
* update 700 array lists on the Pojo
* display 5 of them on screen

And here is the associated flamegraph, zoomed on the relevant section:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38165258-a81f3202-3508-11e8-9229-2c0a2d743db0.png)

And here it is, unzoomed, on the search thread, provided for scale:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/536844/38165306-55365312-3509-11e8-9bb2-abc337bdbd30.png)

New plan:

* go through 1000 items,
* display 5 of them
* generate 5 array lists.

(expected improvements: remove the `Integer.valueOf()` subcall, remove the `ArrayList.<init>`, remove the `Integer.intValue`, so roughly 8% faster)

The only thing I had to change was to implement the `public Object getItem(int position)` (one line!) and then I was able to remove unused constructor parameter and implement a function to replace results in one pass (instead of `.clear()` and `.addAll()`, which was triggering `notifyDatasetChanged()`.

`ArrayAdapter` was also thread safe, but since we're doing all our changes from the UI thread we don't need this.

I also removed the `refreshTask` (considered in #906, potentially useful for #937)."

Is this a KISS issue?"
Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-02-27 20:15:44,Forwarder pattern,[],0,"## Why
Over time, `MainActivity` became more and more bloated with unrelated concerns. Right now, it's a behemoth --- 1200 lines of code dealing with UI, widgets, search, favorites, keyboards and app list.

This makes onboarding new contributors harder than required, and leads to confusion (""do we still need this line of code? Why is it used, under which situations and for which settings""?)

## What
To solve this problem, I'm trying to implement a Forwarder pattern (think Delegation).

Roughly speaking, there is a `ForwarderManager`. The `MainActivity` will call the `ForwarderManager` during certain lifecycle events (more can be defined easily). In turn, the manager will forward the call to any interested subclass of `Forwarder`.

Strictly speaking, the manager should ignore the business logic of every Forwarder, but for performance reasons, I'd rather manually call any function that has to be called (rather than loop over each Forwarder). An interesting side effect is that a Forwarder can access the ForwarderManager and communicate with other forwarders if it needs it.

## Will it change anything?
If I manage to do this properly, then nothing will change. There will be more lines of code, but the MainActivity will be easier to understand and features should be properly contained within their Forwarder.

## Which forwarder will we have?
I'm just getting started, but so far I'd say:

- [x] Widget forwarder
- [x] Wallpaper forwarder
- [x] Favorites forwarder
- [x] UI forwarder (for all the UI tweaks)
- [x] UX forwarder (for all the UX tweaks)

It's unclear yet how relevant it would be to create forwarders for more ""core features"" (all apps list? history?)

Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-01-31 22:37:35,Another attempt at fixing app flickering,[],0,"Related to #801.

Looking at #801, I'm wondering if we're talking about the same thing, or if maybe my device behaves in a weird way.

I'll explain what I'm trying to fix *here*, and then we can decide if that was indeed the same issue or just me misunderstanding what ""flicker"" meant.

In my case, when searching for apps, for a couple ms (just enough for the eye to register) the app icon displayed will be the same as the app in the same position just before. For instance, if my history contains ""Google Search"" and I search for ""Whatsapp"", for the shortest amount of time I'll see the text ""Whatsapp"" with the ""Google Search"" image.

The same thing happens, for instance, when moving from the history to the app list (provided minimal history is disabled and open keyboard on start is off too, otherwise everything moves and it's hard to tell what's happening).

Another interesting thing is that, sometimes, for reasons probably related to the lazy loading of providers, the app will be refreshed with the exact same Results (let's say, for instance, I only have apps in my history, then the contact provider finishes to load and all the images are displayed again).

This fix will:

* Ensure no loading happens if the image currently displayed is already the one we'd load (for instance, when you launch an app, history is refreshed in the background which sometimes caused the app icon to disappear/reappear)
* Ensure the image currently used is cleared as soon as the record is displayed on screen
* Remove the current caching strategy"

For example, with the browser Lightning, only the generic Play Store version gets the icon changed and not the Lightning+/F-Droid version.
Other launchers such as Nova have this option to manually change the icon but I've noticed that KISS does not, even though it's superior in every other conceivable way.

Hopefully I'm not the only one that would be interested in this and it will be implemented in the future."

Here are the steps to reproduce:

- install an app that provide a widget (I used ""netatmo weather"", but I think any app would do)
- add the widget to kiss

Observed: kiss launches, and quickly crashes, in loop.
Expected: kiss launches and deactivates the widget.
Workaround: delete kiss data from the android app info menu disables the phantom widget (but also deletes all the pref, etc.)

I think that plugin support is a good way to keep KISS simple and lightweight and at the same time it's a good way to add a lot of functionality.

Moreover plugins would keep a low number of permissions request. These permission would be required for each single plugin (e.g. would be also possible to remove contacts permission and make it available in a Contact plugin).

For example with plugins would be possible to add particular search provider such as:

- search files
- currency/units converter
- simple math
- specific app task (e.g. typing ""addnote buy bread"" add a new note in a specific note app that support KISS plugins)
- etc...

3. A widget dialog appears so I press OK.
4. The shortcut appears on my home screen.

The layout boundaries of the search and favorite bars were extended to the edge of the background. Additionally, shared paddings, heights, and widths are now in `dimens.xml`.

**tl;dr**: There is an app selling a modified KISS version on the Play Store. KISS is GPL. They claim they published it while it was still MIT. But they have new features. Anyone with legal knowledge on the topic?

-----

Play Store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plh.note7slide

Since KISS licence is GPL, I sent this first email:

```
Hi,

I'm Neamar on Github, owner of the https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/ repository on which Slide Launcher is based.

Kiss licence is GNU/GPL v3.

Although you're more than welcome to create your own fork of the project and add features, you also need to comply with the project's original licence at https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/blob/master/LICENSE

You're allowed to sell the project if you want to, but in your case, you also need to:

* Open source the changes you built on top of KISS (grid view, etc.)
* Ensure that you mention the original project is KISS. A link in your Play Store description should be enough.

Thanks for your attention, congrats on your changes -- looking forward to seeing them online :)
```

After this email, the description for the PRO version (not the standard one) was updated to mention ""Neamar/Kiss"" in text (no link). The lite version doesn't mention anything, but in the app, settings, legal, you can see ""© Matthieu Bacconnier 2015"" -- that's my name, but I never had any © on KISS.

I had no reply to my email, but @eevleevs contacted them, saw they didn't want to change anything and reminded me of the problem. So I sent another email:

```
Hello again,

I noticed that you changed the description in the Store, thanks. I'd appreciate if you could make it a link, either to the Play Store or Github.

However, you haven't open-sourced your changes, which is the second requirement from the GPL licence.

It also looks like in discussions with other persons, you failed to mention you had already been asked to publish the source code.

Please do it before next Friday (that will give you a month of notice since my first email), since respecting the license will mean a better ecosystem for everyone's app -- plus, as you make money out of the app, it's only fair that you comply with the legal requirements.

Thanks for your attention again. Hopefully, I won't have to send another mail next week...
```

This time, I got an answer, asking me ""how to open-source"", and claiming that Slide Launcher was on the Store while KISS was still MIT (July 3rd, 2016 https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/commit/1443adc77a89d4ec5dde3e0378d0da06b626b682).

A quick look at the app, which is very similar to KISS indeed, let me think they've incorporated features published in KISS since then (color change at least), and from my understanding of GPL the licence is sticky which means that by pulling part of the code they agree to publish all of the code.

Anyone here with some legal knowledge on the matter? Would like to double check I'm correct before asking for Play Store arbitration."

This is the currently most complained about feature in the Play Store: a lot of people hate the green bar.

This PR builds on previous work I did on #630, but a lot has changed since then, especially with the dropped support of older SDKs.

Changing the main color will:

* change kiss logo color
* change standard favorite bar background color
* change phone and messaging icon on contacts
* change highlight color in search result
* change notification bar color (Android L and above only)
* Change action bar color in settings (but not in subscreens for some reason?)

The following won't change, because they're too complex to manage (or I'm too stupid [lazy?] to figure out how to do it):

* loading spinner indicator when opening app for the first time
* toggle color in Toggle search results (and in KISS settings)
* cursor color in search box

Needs to be tested on Android < L before merge.

Left to do:

* [x] Use defined color on MainActivity and Results
* [x] Let primary color and notification color be different if you want to (e.g. transparent notification bar while still using KISS green)
* [x] Add semi-transparent black in the color list
* [x] Hide notification bar color pre-L
* [x] Try to display the colors directly in the DialogPicker, instead of using their english names

I think it would be great if KISS had an option to add virtual folders. It would work like this:

2. Click ""Add to folder""
3. If there are already folders, present list, else let user add a new folder, e.g. ""Games""
4. Start typing ""Games"": The folder comes up
5. Click on the folders and only see apps that were previously added to the folder. (Indicate that one is inside a folder by, for example, changing search bar colour, like with the ""all apps"" view vs ""recent apps"" view.)

I hope I explained myself well, if not, I'll try to answer your questions! :)

Anyways here's the email I sent to the address from the play store but it I was told that here would be better this way to get a feature request(hopefully it's a small one)seen. 

""Hi. 

I'm an avid fan of your launcher. I've added reviews to your launcher on the play store under the name Scott Deez. 


Anyways I thought emailing you might be a quicker way to get your attention. So I do have one feature request: Is it possible to get the bottom search bar totally transparent, with the green circle 'home' button still being visible? 


Because I do use the dark transparent theme with a plain black wallpaper. And there's another launcher like yours(kind of a rip off of yours) and that search bar is totally transparent. And my screen looks really sexy with the black wallpaper and the transparent bar... 


Well, I'm sure you're busy but wanted to drop a line anyways to ask if you could fit this request in at some point. 


Best launcher there is. So easy. Really appreciate what you've done/doing.

Neamar/KISS,closed,2016-12-21 14:09:17,[NEW FEATURE] Added option to change Default Launcher,[],0,"We've added an option, located under 'Advanced Settings', for the user to be able to change his default launcher.

It was fairly easy to locate the parts in the source code that needed to be modified. Since the feature we wanted to implement consisted of adding an option to the settings screen, we knew from the start that most of our changes would be focused around the file *preferences.xml*.

Adding the extra option to the settings screen was the easy part. We just had to add an extra entry to *preferences.xml* and create a new *Preference* class.

*preferences.xml*
```java
<PreferenceScreen android:title=""@string/title_advanced"">
    <fr.neamar.kiss.preference.DefaultLauncherPreference
        android:dialogMessage=""@string/default_launcher_warn""
        android:key=""default-launcher""
        android:title=""@string/default_launcher_title""/>
```

*DefaultLauncherPreference.java*

```java
public class DefaultLauncherPreference extends DialogPreference {

}
```

The difficult part came afterwards. We had to find a way to change the Default Launcher.

Well, turns out this is simply impossible to do programmatically. As you can imagine, allowing an application to set the default behavior of the phone would be a major security problem.

As such, the only solution was to ask the user to change the Default Launcher himself. But how could this be accomplished?

We could create an [App Chooser](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/sending.html#AppChooser), but that raised a problem. It didn't allow the user to set an app as default. It only allowed to select the app for that *specific* action, at that *specific* moment. So this wouldn't be any good.

After struggling for a while to find an answer, we came across [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13167583/clearing-and-setting-the-default-home-application/13239706#13239706) post, on Stack Overflow.

And so, we decided to follow this approach.

We simply had to *trick* the phone, in order for it to think that there was a new app installed, so that it would show the App Chooser (notice that this chooser now has the option to set default apps, since it was launched by the System itself, and not programmatically).

In order to do this, we created a dummy (or fake - however you want to call it) Activity. As the name suggest, this is just a *completely* empty Activity. But this alone isn't enough. We need to tell the System that there is, in fact, a new app capable of receiving *Home* intents (the *Intent* launched when the *Home Button* is pressed). This was done in the *AndroidManifest.xml*, by declaring an *intent-filter*.

*DummyActivity.java*
```java
public class DummyActivity extends Activity {

}
```

*AndroidManifest.xml*
```java
<activity android:name="".DummyActivity"">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />
        <category android:name=""android.intent.category.HOME"" />
        <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />
    </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

Now, all that was left was to fill the *DefaultLauncherPreference* and trick the phone into launching an App Chooser through the System.

This was done by creating a new *ACTION_MAIN Intent*, with a *HOME* category associated to it, and then launching it.


*DefaultLauncherPreference.java*
```java
// create a new (implicit) intent with MAIN action
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
// add HOME category to it
intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME);
// launch intent
context.startActivity(intent);
```

However, after the first time this was used, it would stop working, because the phone would no longer assume the DummyActivity was a new app. The phone already knew it, so the App Chooser wouldn't launch, since the user had already selected what default app he wanted.

In order to avoid this, DummyActivity needs to start off disabled, in order to *hide* it from the system. It then gets enabled when it's time to launch the intent that will trick the phone. After that, it is disabled once again, in order for it to be reusable the next time we need to trick the phone.

*AndroidManifest.xml*
```java
<activity android:name="".DummyActivity""
      android:enabled=""false"">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />
          <category android:name=""android.intent.category.HOME"" />
          <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />
      </intent-filter>
  </activity>
```

*DefaultLauncherPreference.java*
```java
// get dummyActivity
ComponentName componentName = new ComponentName(context, DummyActivity.class);

// enable dummyActivity (it starts disabled in the manifest.xml)
packageManager.setComponentEnabledSetting(componentName, PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_ENABLED, PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);

// create a new (implicit) intent with MAIN action
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN);
// add HOME category to it
intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_HOME);
// launch intent
context.startActivity(intent);

// disable dummyActivity once again
packageManager.setComponentEnabledSetting(componentName, PackageManager.COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED, PackageManager.DONT_KILL_APP);
```

And it is complete. Now, everytime the user selects the option to change the Default Launcher, an App Chooser will appear.

Neamar/KISS,closed,2018-01-05 12:06:40,Performance improvement suggestion,[],0,"Dear developers,
I found a bitmap displaying issues in Kiss. These issues could affect performance. 
In the position of Kiss:
fr.neamar.kiss.IconsHandler.java     cacheGetDrawable()
the bitmap object is created with the invocation of decodeStream(). 

I found cacheGetDrawable() is invoked indirectly by:
fr.neamar.kiss.adapter.RecordAdapter.java    getView()
getView() callbacks are frequently invoked in the UI thread and this means that there will be many bitmap objects being created.

Maybe we can define memory cache to store the bitmap objects. Then app can reuse them instead of creating new bitmap objects continuously. Also, we can use the Option.inbitmap to reuse the memory space of existing bitmap objects, which will greatly reduce the memory consumption and improves app's performance.

By the way, for bitmap displaying, I was also wondering why you do not use third-party libraries such as picasso, glide? Would you mind sharing some thoughts?

Looking forward to your response and hope I can help improve Kiss.
Thanks.

I found an issue I am struggling with. I use owncloud to import my contacts. When I had to rename a contact in owncloud and synced it back to the phone, the new name is not reflected in the search results, but only in the contact itself when opened in the contact app.

How-to:
1. Sync contacts from owncloud to phone.
2. Search contact in KISS with the current name (a) -> success.
3. Rename contact in owncloud.
4. Sync contacts from owncloud to phone. 
5. Search contact in KISS with the changed current name (b) -> no success
6. Search contact in KISS with the previous name (a) -> success.
7. Open contact via KISS -> preview shows the previous name (a).
8. Edit contact in contact app -> changed name (b) is displayed.

---
- At this point I am not quite sure if this is an issue with KISS or with the underlying android, since the contact preview also does not reflect the change.
- After changing the phonetic name within the contact app, also the contact preview got updated and KISS shows the correct name. This is also available in the KISS search then.
- Other changes (like changing the contact picture) are immediatly available after the contact sync.

Details would need to be discussed (I guess we could have a Hangouts / discord / Skype / ... call to align our goals on the project), but the main idea would be to be the bad guy that say no to 50% of the feature and give constructive feedback on the other 50% :)

Of course, my favorite hypothetical co-admin would be someone who already contribute to the project and comment on issues -- I'm not going to list names because that wouldn't make a lot of sense, but I have a few people in mind that could be interesting, and would hopefully be interested too!

Looking forward to iron out the details with you guys :)

Addendum: hell, fuck this -- It actually makes sense to list some names, at least so people know what's going on! Apologies to those I forgot: @alexander255  @AltNico @ilmich @licaon-kter  @nmitsou @Pluggi

1. numbers are always shown in the keyboard widget, and
2. gesture typing is disabled.

I fully understand why this is a reasonable setting. However,
1. I never enter numbers in KISS. The extra row however takes away precious space that would otherwise reveal another history item (6 instead of 5 items, a 20% increase in history shown!), and
2. as I use gesture typing anywhere else, the KISS keyboard gets me stuck, which is frustrating and slows down significantly. It gets most painful when I want to use it for internet search, where you enter several words.

Therefore I would very much appreciate if both of these decisions could be made by the user through settings.

As mentioned in #501 , Kiss could be visible in the application list but under the following assumptions:
- Your excluded list app is not set (new KISS installation)
- You have uninstalled an app (any app)

Edit:
Let me explain one more time how this bug works.
If a user has never excluded any app through KISS and used the 2.24.1 version, then the moment that he uninstalls an app (any app) then KISS will be visible in the application list.
To fix that he would have to manually exclude KISS from the application list.

Two options: drop support for older SDK (up to which one?) or restore a working build.

According to the Playstore, here are the versions currently in use:

Ordering of apps based on `frecency = frequency * recency`
`Frequency = number_of_launches_for_app / total_number_of_launches`
`Recency = 1 / position in normal history = 1/ (max(id) in history - max(app_id))`

The ordering is computed inside the sql query. Group by is needed. To avoid group by on all hisotry results i first limit to the 750 latest history entries. My initial tests indicate that smart history is ~2x slower than the normal history (which I think is still fine).

So, what I came up with, is to add a checkbox for non-default wallpaper that will add a ""Set as KISS Wallpaper"" option in the gallery. Maybe under Share...

Personally I always find my apps searching with text or looking at the history without using the bar. I think that the best approach (imho again) is giving the user the ability to choose a list of favourite apps to show in the main screen instead of the history (from the setting the user should be allowed to choose history/favourite). @nmitsou has already implemented this feature (see #346), the overhead of code introduced in KISS is quite small and KISS won't be much more complex with that great addition.

Comparaison with #361:
- Highlighting of the matched text
- Maybe faster
- Cannot auto-correct typos (`clogk -> clock`)

This PR also adds support for multi-part highlighting.

Here is how the score is calculated:
- A positive match is given the base score of 20
- 30 points are given gradually with the percentage of characters matched
- 50 points are given gradually with the percentage of word starting characters matched (uppercase, or preceded by a whitespace). This allows queries that contain the beginning of a word to have a much better ranking.
- => This totals to a score going from 20 to 100
- The more fragmented the matches are, the less the result is significant (see [this line for the actual formula](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/compare/fuzzysearch?expand=1#diff-e39439cc0b190cd66e530d81fd898679R80)).

Can someone test it and provide some feedback, especially on the ranking of the apps?

Neamar/KISS,closed,2016-01-05 19:20:29,[IDEA] Publish the search functionality as a standalone app in the Play Store,[],0,"The whole app's idea is great.
But some of us looking for a tiny bit more function here and there.
Again, that is not everyone - maybe not even the majority.
And having more functions go against the KISS principle.

**The idea**:  
- Have the search (when the keyboard pops up) bundled in a separate, tiny app. 
- This new app should contain the same functionality, without being a launcher.
- This new app should allow to be opened with the long-press of Home.
  - Like Google Now. KISS Launcher already allows this. 
  - The app should still have an icon, so Home Launcher or other shortcut callers could launch it as well. Such as gesture calls in other Launchers.

**Why not just open the launcher?**
Reason is simple: While the launcher is tiny, Android can still slow down to load it.
Then, since it's a launcher, it stays in memory.
While the app itself is tiny, the Developer and Application Manager tools show a ~100MB of RAM usage.
This ram usage can be shared I realize, but on my Exynos 5433 the search window still takes quite a few seconds to pop up from a different launcher, which means the phone does have to work extensively to load it up.

  **I do realize that this requires additional work.** But it should be a fast process. Literally drag and dropping almost all the files, removing the launcher part, call it a day.

This will also affect the spellcheck and force portrait settings. You probably need KISS to be set as the default Launcher to see this effect too and it may only affect Android 5+.

It seems that Android is unwilling to fully unload the Launcher activity and if you force it to then you get to stare at your app drawer for a few seconds while it restarts.

I believe that the spellcheck setting can be removed from the list that requires restart though if you implement it in the onResume with another int like

```
private final int spellcheckDisabledType = InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT | 
            InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_VISIBLE_PASSWORD |
            InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS;

to restore the EditText to its default InputType value when spellcheck is disabled. It might be a good idea to look into ways to remove the forced restarts for other options too.

This is my reply to the comments on #335.

@alexander255 's [comment](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/pull/335#issuecomment-164754840) was very imformative, and ties in with [this issue](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/834) I found, which suggests 2 ways of resolving the failing tests. So, to summarise, here are the options I think we could take:
1. Inject mocks into the `onServiceConnected` method that is causing the issues. See [this comment](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/834#issuecomment-28605830) for more info on this idea.
2. Follow [this comment](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/834#issuecomment-60786401), which is basically what @alexander255 was suggesting, I think, when he was talking about registering the services with Robolectric. Note I haven't tried this.
3. Don't test `MainActivity` with Robolectric as it uses services and Robolectric focusses on testing an individual activity on its own (again, see [this issue](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/834)). It may make sense to test `SettingsActivity` with it though.
4. Get rid of robolectric and just use Espresso.

My preference is to go with the 3rd option, as it is quick and easy and Espresso tests can cover testing `MainActivity`.

But KISS is still compiling for Lollipop.

The biggest problem here is runtime permissions.

User is asked to give some specific permission at runtime, and not at install time.

As usual, the Android team messed up pretty hard and made everything way more complex than it could have been... adding more callbacks everywhere, and requiring an activity for pretty much any action.

Anyway. The problematic permission are the following ones:
- `READ_CONTACTS`
- `CALL_PHONE`
- `CAMERA`
- `READ_PHONE_STATE`
- `RECEIVE_SMS`

The first one, `READ_CONTACTS` is a core KISS feature, asking for it on the first run seems a good idea.

The second one, `CALL_PHONE` is required to call someone. We can probably ensure that we only ask for this permission when the user clicks on the phone button on a contact (although we'd have to handle the fact that this does not occur within the activity, and the callback is therefore called without any context, making our code much harder to understand)

Moving on. `CAMERA` is only required for the torch toggle. Same thing, asking for this at the latest moment seems the most sane option, and will also require some fiddling around with the activity ><

`READ_PHONE_STATE` and `RECEIVE_SMS` are actually easier. Since #325 they're disabled by default, which means we can ask for permission when the user checks them in the Settings screen. And the good news is that this time, we do have an activity to handle the callback!

From what I gather, all other permissions currently used by KISS are deemed safe and can be used without asking explicitly for user permission.

On a sidenote: migrating to marshmallow does not bring much to KISS in itself, but it's an investment for the future. And who knows, there may be some performance improvements!

Neamar/KISS,closed,2015-12-03 23:09:20,KISS crashes after installation if shortcut provider is disabled (or not yet available),[],0,"# Steps to reproduce
1. Disable the _Shortcuts_ _Data Provider_ in the KISS settings
2. Reinstall KISS (from `.apk`/`gradle`)
# Additional information

I originally thought that this was something introduced by me while working on #269. It turns out however that making provider initialization asynchronous, just makes the problem always show up, instead of only when the _Shortcuts_ _Data Provider_ is disabled.
The problem probably happens because (1) KISS always expects the _Shortcuts_ _Data Provider_ to be present and (2) KISS' own installation triggers a ""package installed"" broadcast.

After some investigation, it looks like the app which exhibits this behavior (Bankin', Dropbox) also come with a ""custom widget"" (in Google Now launcher, for instance, you can create a shortcut to open a folder directly).

Those applications have the intent-filter `<action android:name=""android.intent.action.CREATE_SHORTCUT""/>` in their manifest for one of their activity (see for instance https://github.com/Neamar/CineTime/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L89)

It looks like this triggers a ""global"" install shortcut upon installation, which leads to the shortcut appearing on KISS.

Two questions:
- if this is indeed why we get a shortcut, it should at least be for this customactivity handling the shortcut creation, not for the main activity
- how can we filter this and remove this? Or even more important, can we open this activity to let the user create a shortcut to display on KISS?

I think that it's nice to have icon theming on KISS Launcher.

I've take a look on ADW.Launcher source code to see how icon theming works and seems not difficult.
First problem is to detect installed icon sets, there are two ways

1) define a KISS intent that every icon pack developer must include into AndroidManifest.xml in order to launch a intent query that scan packagename for available icon sets (in order to get resource icons from external apk)
2) use, for intent query, another most supporter launcher (for example ADW)

It's not completed (for example it's not possible to uninstall a shortcut) mainly because i want to share my code and wait for comments.
I've also some questions:

1) shortcuts can be enabled/disabled, but I don't know if it's better to ignore install_shortcut event (when shortcuts are disabled), or install shortcut and disable only the search

2) for now shortcut with embedded icon are ignored (whatsapp contact shortcut for example) because in this case the icon must be stored into database or kiss storage area. What do you think it's the best place!??!

When KISS Launcher is started, the keyboard slides up and hides a lower portion of the app list. Once it's up, the list adjusts and jumps to match the keyboards position.

The problem is that during a few hundred milliseconds when the keyboard is appearing, I'm able to locate the icon that would like to click. By the time the keyboard is fully shown, the lists jumps and I have to find the icon again. Very irritating! ;)

It happens only at the beginning with automatic keyboard activated, e.g. when KISS launcher is associated with the home button. Later, I can switch the keyboard on and off, and there's no such problem: it seems that the list jumps up first and then the keyboard unrolls next.

Maybe this could be linked up with my non-high-end device (i9100 @ 1 GB RAM) because the short 'wink'-time differs, (e. g. if I have opened more apps in the background). But this behaviour also appears shortly after I clear my recent apps.

"
Neamar/KISS,closed,2015-12-15 13:01:43,Make DataHandler an Android service,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"Currently KISS will terminate when the system is somewhat low on memory. Since KISS is usually the system launcher it will generally be the last background activity killed. Once the KISS `.MainActivity` is killed it has to rescan all data sources on its next start-up.

While the current situation isn't too bad it would, I think, be better to migrate KISS' `DataHandler` to an Android service to reduce the risk of it being killed (services are killed last). Also killed services are automatically restarted once their required memory becomes available again (so even if the service is killed it might be ready again by the time the user returns to the launcher). 

I've looked into the Android documentation and it seems that moving `DataHandler` into its own Android service isn't all that hard (as long as you don't try to share that service with other processes). See [this example](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html#Binder) for details.
## Steps to reproduce (artificial but always works)
1. Open _Device Settings_ → _Developer Options_
2. Change _Apps_ → _Background process limit_ to _No background processes_ (Process means Activity in this case)
3. Install some random launcher (using any App Store)
4. Press the home button
   - It should ask you which launcher to open
5. Select some launcher **other than KISS** from the list
6. Start _KISS Launcher_ from the other launcher
7. Press the home button again
8. Select the other launcher again
9. Start _KISS Launcher_ from the other launcher again
## Step to reproduce (more realistic)
1. Open KISS Launcher (while its the home screen launcher)
2. Start some memory intensive application
3. Wait until KISS' activity is stopped in the background (using `logcat` for instance)
4. Press the home button
## What should happen?

_KISS Launcher_ should be closed when opening the other launcher/doing the memory intensive task and started again when returning to it. On the second invocation it SHOULD NOT have to rescan all its data sources again (being unusable while doing so).

However, that's a neverending task. You simply can't keep up with all the apps out there, especially without clogging KISS.

So here's another idea: provide an entry point, I think Android calls them ""intents"", that any app willing to be a provider could use to register searchable content. And if you come up with a generic name, even other apps than KISS could benefit from those, which in turn means more providers.

What do you think?

Mostly string normalization means de-accenting and lower-casing of letters.
Examples of this include:
- French/German/Swedish/Estonian/Hungarian/Finnish/Icelandic diaeresis: `Ä` → `a`, `ä` → `a`, `ë` → `e`, `Ö` → `o`, `ö` → `o`, `Ü` → `u`, `ü` → `u` 
- French/Italian/Spain/Polish/Czech/Slovak/Macedon acutes: `À` → `a`, `á` → `a`, `È` → `e`, `é` → `e`, `Ì` → `i`, `í` → `i`, `Ò` → `o`, `ó` → `o`, `Ù` → `u`, `ú` → `u`, `ý` → `y`
- Hungarian double acutes: `Ő` → `o`, `ő` → `o`, `Ű` → `u`, `ű` → `u`

While the list could certainly be extended, [implementing all possible cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=674250888) would be a lot of work (279 standardized combinations!). Instead I'd suggest [using something like this code](https://gist.github.com/alexander255/d431ea365216d05ec32d), which handles all possible combinations that exist today as well as _all future combinations added Unicode_ (unless I messed up something). It also handles characters that have (effectively) the same meaning but different codepoints (such as `㎏` → `kg`, `Ⅰ` → `I` or `Ⅱ` → `II`), while that may not be relevant for keyboard input it wouldn't be surprising to have apps use such characters in their names (and it actually requires just one extra _character_ of code to implement this, see the inline documentation.)

This is similar to how [DDG's `!bang`s](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) work, but a little different (you don't add anything to your query (e.g. `!g`), you just select the app to search in). Have a look at how Firefox for android does it:

- I think we should enable all providers by default, and enable newly installed providers. It'll probably be easy to write bugs here
- I'm closing #124, because I like this idea better. However:
  - Some of that code may still be useful, feel free to grab it from [my ddg branch](https://github.com/losingkeys/KISS/tree/ddg)
  - I _think_ there was a _slight_ performance hit when [reading the default search provider value from `preferences.xml`](https://github.com/losingkeys/KISS/blob/b54328efbe432404e8ee1c8ca752b57d050034b4/app/src/main/java/fr/neamar/kiss/DataHandler.java#L49-L51), because it would lag enough to trigger [StrictMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode.html)'s red border right after I hit the home button.

I came across a few things ([tracingview (code changes)](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/debugging-tracing.html), [leakcanary (code changes)](https://github.com/square/leakcanary)), but the easiest thing I found was a developer setting:

https://developer.android.com/tools/performance/profile-gpu-rendering/index.html

Here are some screenshots from a recent build of master:

This is what it looks like when you scroll around a lot. Nothing to worry about here, it's under the green (16ms) line, so it should be @ 60fps (like [the docs](https://developer.android.com/tools/performance/profile-gpu-rendering/index.html) say).

![screenshot_2015-07-08-19-54-35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/666493/8585784/86c6fa04-25ac-11e5-8af4-270d6fdc98dc.png)

The graph looks like the above image if I leave it for awhile. This is strange because, if I leave it in (for example) the device settings, the graph doesn't progress until I start scrolling. This makes me think that something is happening each second. Reading  [the docs](https://developer.android.com/tools/performance/profile-gpu-rendering/index.html) again, it says that the red space is ""time spent by Android's 2D renderer issuing commands to OpenGL to draw and redraw display lists"". Does this mean the list is being updated/messed with each second? 

This could all be wrong; I'm fairly new to android. Anyway let me know what you think!

Also: updated English translations to indicate we were doing a search,
not necessarily from the web (uses the Google Search app if possible,
and I intend to add support for the DDG app in the future).

Still todo (mostly copied from app/src/main/java/fr/neamar/kiss/result/DuckduckgoSearchResult.java):
- Use DDG app if available
- Programatically grab !bang commands and parse them for names (maybe

- Brightness (auto/manual)
- Flashlight
- ~~WiFi~~ (already working in app)
- ~~Bluetooth~~ (already working in app)
- Sound Profile (vibrate/loud)
- Interruptions
- NFC
- Screen Rotation (auto/fixed)
- Location
- Airplane mode (linked in this app, not yet a toggle; I opened #109 to see if it can be made a toggle)
- SmartShare Beam (not sure what this is, might be an LG thing)
- Battery Saver (I think this just toggles whether or not the battery save mode turns on @ 15%. Not sure if I can just toggle it on when I want to save battery. Might be an LG thing)
- ~~QuickMemo+~~ (this is an LG app, so it's already linked in this app)
- ~~QuickRemote~~ (another LG app, already linked because it's an app)
- LED
- Accounts & sync
- QSlide (LG thing?)
- Voice Mate (LG thing?)
- Screen timeout (could be handy for debugging w/o setting that adb setting)
- Cell Data
- Miracast (LG thing? Though this might just be in Android)
- Screen Color Inversion

So it's probably not worth implementing all of the LG things, and I'm not honestly sure how many of these you have access to, but imo it'd be useful to have toggles to these. :beers:

I noticed after searching for, and using the bluetooth toggle it didn't stay in the list.

If this was implemented, it'd probably be a good idea to either watch when they changed (so you could update the on/off value accordingly), because I have toggles in my notifications and settings areas too (so I could change the value outside of this list).

I believe this can grow fairly complex, even using the architecture Android provides us (public providers).

Maybe it could be better to improve our current search providers, and add some actions (buttons on the right) :
- Search on the web, default action (using browser intent)
- Search on maps (using geo: intent)
- Search on phone (using default google search, already using this providers)

That way, we can keep our results fast (not guaranteed if we use other app providers, often using slooow data connection).
