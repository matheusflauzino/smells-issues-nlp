caarmen/network-monitor,open,,view log file ui enhancement,[],0,"Hello,

I would like to propose a change that will greatly enhance the usability of viewing the log. After all the gist of this app is reviewing the log file periodically.

Currently the view is that of a spreadsheet with way too many columns which makes difficult the viewing and also makes it difficult to be certain which is the right line that is being viewed (despite the alternate line coloring).

I suggest two enhancement variations

1. the ""fields to monitor"" selection screen select the fields that will be displayed in the spreadsheet (same functionality as of now), but it will be possible to click on a row and get to a new ""detail"" screen that lists all fields (vertically preferably)
in this variation all fields are really monitored always but we select which to view quickly in the spreadsheet so we pick the row of interest and if we like we can peek deeper to see all fields

2. this is same as 1. except the following difference
the ""fields to monitor"" selection screen will now contain two check marks for each field, the 1st check mark selects the field to be displayed in the spreadsheet and the 2nd selects if it will be monitored and displayed in the ""detail"" screen

I think option 1. is much easier to implement"

------------
The speed download test specifies 
https://github.com/caarmen/network-monitor/archive/netmon-1.12.2.zip
as the target.
The archive directory seems not to exist, so the test cannot work.

Steps to reproduce:
-------------------
Select Advanced Options => Speed Test => Download Test to see the URL.
Browse to https://github.com/caarmen/network-monitor/ and see that the URL target does not exist.

I was monitoring the network signal of the area and noticed from the log file that when ASU level was 11 the dBm was -91 always and (0-3) 3 and when it was 8 the dBm was -97 and again (0-3) 3. 
I've checked from the system in Settings, About Phone, Status, SIM status, Signal strength while the log was running and the ASU value was correct the other data was different.

caarmen/network-monitor,open,,"The app crashes and exits by itself while accessing the ""Frequency Log"" feature when changing the rotation to landscape mode and back to portrait mode.",[],0,"
#### Expected behavior
Supposedly, when accessing the ""Frequency Log"" feature and when changing the screen rotation 2 times, the app will not experience errors.

#### Actual behavior
When I click on the ""Frequency Log"" feature and after being on the Log frequency setting page, I accidentally changed the rotation to landscape mode, and when returned to portrait mode again, the app crashes and exits by itself. I have done the repetition, but the error persists.


#### How to reproduce
1. Install and Open apps
2. Next click the feature ""Log Frequency""
3. If the log frequency settings page is open, change the rotation to landscape mode, and then return the rotation to the portrait mode. *Then you will find the error as I experienced.*

    * Use `JobIntentService` instead of `IntentService`"
caarmen/network-monitor,closed,2017-08-08 23:10:30,WIFI and mobile network history capability,[],0,"Hello,

I had asked for the enhancement of issue #94 and I am glad you acted so swiftly. Also congratulations for the great work you do. I hope I have some free time in the future and I contribute too.

I would like to ask you for a very much needed feature that it would be great to implement or perhaps spin-off into a separate app. Let me explain.

I use your app not to check a connection but with the intent to check when (exact time) and to which WIFI station (name, ethernet address, and other info) my mobile connects or disconnects to. Same for mobile connection. I can do this because you provide the WIFI and mobile connection details along with many other data (even when no data connection is done).

But this approach is not very accurate because I have set the log every 5 minutes in order to conserve cpu/log size etc., it is not so practical (I have to wade thru the log and trim it regularly and if I forget to do this and the log grows big, I'm in trouble)  and also it is not efficient in the end.

Believe me, this is a very much needed and useful capability for many reasons. Just a single and indirect usage example is that I use it to record power grid failure and restart time :D (using apps that record mobile charging/discharging is not helpful because most are not working reliably and I must have the phone on the charger always; there are other uses too relating to mobile security).

In order to do this, you do not need to log periodically but rather catch the intents that indicate network connections or disconnections and record them. 

There is no other app that has this capability (well not exactly, there are 1-2 but don't work correctly).

This could be an extra feature of your current app (best with a separate log) or a new app (mostly a copy of the old with many things removed and just the new feature implemented and why not even include charging/discharging history :D).

I hope you implement it considering its usefulness, uniqueness and rather easy implementation."

Just setting the interval to very slow is not an option since I also want to keep track of the signal strength. 

The download and upload speed does not change as much as the signal strength. So to enable high accuracy on the speed test I just made it so that the test is not run on every tick, there are different levels of how often one want to run the speed test.

The implementation for the network change and dbm change options are probably not the most accurate since I only check these when the application requests a speed test and not when the changes occurs.
