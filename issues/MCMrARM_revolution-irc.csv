By typing on a Bluetooth keyboard, then hitting Ctrl+A, I can use Revolution's own context menu rather than the Text Selection bar's one to select Format (I'm now realizing this is probably how people are expected to do formatting). The Text Selection bar is obscuring the top of Revolution such that I can't touch its context menu button while text is selected via touch. However, I can use it if I select text using a keyboard. However, this leads to my next issue:

When I select text with Shift and the cursor keys, the Format option doesn't appear in the context menu at all. This is an unusual enough use case that I wonder if it might even be an issue on stock Android. Seems like something that'd be worth testing with a Bluetooth keyboard, Android and Revolution on a more normal device.

MCMrARM/revolution-irc,open,,Warn about addressing an absent nick,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"One of the problems of using an IRC from a phone or tablet is that typing is slow, so one is much more likely (compared with IRC from traditional devices) to encounter the situation where you're writing something to another user in a channel, and they leave or quit before you hit send.

Ideally, as soon as a nick is fully mentioned at the start of a message (with nick+colon), a check would be done to whether the user is currently in the channel, and as the message is being typed this check would be repeated periodically.

If at any time while typing, the other nick leaves or quits, give a strong visual warning; I suggest turning the text entry area red, if that's not too hard to implement.

Then the user could immediate stop wasting effort typing a message that the intended recipient will never see.

If the same behaviour could be done in PM sessions, that would be a bonus, but I suspect it would be much more difficult without ""leave"" or ""quit"" notifications from the server."

Now I am doing the mistake of `@TGuser` and when the user is also on IRC, I mention the IRC connection as RevolutionIRC stealthily removes the @ from the message.

I don't know how this should be implemented, my first though would be it being lesser evil of just having the @¬†visible for other users, but then I thought that it's likely that some clients ignore `@nick` being the same as `nick` and it would probably lead to complaints from users saying that everyone tells them that they don't need the @ in IRC."

```
4.4.2 Notice

      Command: NOTICE
   Parameters: <nickname> <text>

   The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between a client automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
   with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
   actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
   loop with another automaton.

   See PRIVMSG for more details on replies and examples.
```

and I see this generally interpreted that NOTICE is a less important message than PRIVMSG while Revolution IRC appears to send a notification and also vibrates and plays the notification sound.

In spirit of the RFC, my bot is sending all messages as notices except messages it relays from other networks and [Matrix](https://matrix.org) has copied this behaviour and their [IRC bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc) causes all bot messages to appear as NOTICEs at IRC.

I think the easiest way to reproduce this on freenode is possibly to invite either `mijris[m]` or `ivar[m]` (Matrix bots) into any channel and saying `!ping` where they reply by saying `pong! <ISO8601 date>`. They accept all invites. (They also shouldn't rejoin after kicked.)"

MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,2018-08-18 18:51:22,Target Android O,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""low priority"")]",0,"I'd really love to target Android O instead of N but the new notification channel system introduced in O has a fundamental flaw that makes it harder for this application to adapt it.
After creating a notification channel you can't change it in an way. To make things even worse, the channel is stored on the device forever and even if you delete and recreate it, it's settings will be restored. The recommended (and in fact, the only) way to change settings is to direct the user to the Settings app and let user manage the channel options there. But, you can't change the LED color or vibration pattern settings in that menu. The new Settings interface is way more annoying for the user, as currently the options are easily accessible under the notification options in the app and this would require adding an ugly link to go to settings to change those.

Solutions I can think of:
1. Wait for the next Android release, hope that it becomes more advanced (why do I doubt that...) and then make some sort of a broken Android O support workaround while properly supporting the next release.
2. Create a new unique notification channel every time the settings are changed. Con: we waste a small amount of storage each time.
3. Use the NotificationListenerService to edit the channels. Con: requires to be enabled manually by the user in settings, and can be suspicious as it gives the app full notification access."

Originally, I noticed I could not set user modes for myself (such as `+p`) using the `/mode` command. However, I'm also noticing that I can't set them with `/raw` either.

Typing in `/raw MODE Tynach +p` causes a thing to pop up saying that no such command was found, but it lets me 'send as raw'... After which the server pops this message back at me:

> ```421 Tynach raw :Unknown command```

I finally got it to work by making my own custom command alias, but I feel like this sort of thing should be built in. I poked around the code a bit and saw [CommandAliasManager.java][1], and am tempted to simply send a pull request with an additional `mode` line... But I feel like it'd be more intuitive to users if the two could be merged somehow.
