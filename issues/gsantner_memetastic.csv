I wanted to create a meme from taking a picture in my environment, I expected after using the create meme using mobile camera feature will be something good, since I will have to just take the picture to my taste and use the app to create the meme, without having to minimize and open other apps.

#### Actual behavior
After clicking the camera option to take a picture for the meme, the app responded with *""could not start camera""* and I found out that I was only able to create a meme with selecting images, meaning the camera feature is not making.

#### How to reproduce the bug 
- download memetastic [here on Google Play Store ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.gsantner.memetastic)
- open the app and accept necessary settings
- click the create meme with camera, which is showing at the top of the app, *an addition and a camera icon to describe*
You will find out the feature is not working.

I think the app should have the ""non free assets"" flag on fdroid, since the memes are not available under a free license. I havent checked where the zip meme file is downloaded, but when it's github, you should also add the ""non free network"" flag."
gsantner/memetastic,open,,Overlapping in landscape on memetastic app,"[Label(name=""good first issue""), Label(name=""hacktoberfest"")]",0,"
#### Expected behavior
while lying down i usually like using my phone in landscape mode which makes everything look wider and broad, so i decided opening the memetastic app to test it out only to discover some texts below went missing..

#### Actual behavior
The writings tend to disappear when in landscape mode

#### How to reproduce
Open the memetastic app while in landscape mode.
select your memes category humans/animals/others



* Device Used: Samsung galaxy A3 
* Android Version : 6.0.1

#### Recording Of The Bug
How it looks in portrait mode

Additionally, I always found this popup strange to work with. It's very confusing to specify, ""no, stay on this page,"" because many apps normally equate ""no"" with ""cancel/leave."" If the options and wording can be reversed (so that ""yes"" stays and ""no"" leaves), that would be very helpful. Thanks for your consideration!"

1. It would be nice to set an option to not require a second back-press to exit a meme-in-progress (at the user's own understood risk of text loss). Or maybe there could be an optional/pro auto-save feature.

2. It would be nice if a second back-press wasn't needed if no text was ever entered into the meme."
