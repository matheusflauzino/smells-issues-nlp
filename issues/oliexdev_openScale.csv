oliexdev/openScale,open,,BoneMass value 1byone is incorrect,[],0,"I received a 1byone scale and have been playing around with Openscale and comparing numbers with the 1byone app.

All body composition values are correct except the **Bone Mass** value. As a result the MuscleMass value is also wrong but if I manually insert the correct bonemass value in the muscleMass calculation, the correct number comes out so it is correct.

In order to compare the numbers I yanked out the library from the 1byone executable  so I could run them side by side.

Really amazing how you managed to get these formulas correct from the assembly code! My compliments and I take my hat off!

Regarding solving this bug I have some thoughts:
- You use the 'impedanceValue' in the bonemass function (scaleBtData.setBone(oneByoneLib.getBoneMass(weight, impedanceValue));) but I think this is wrong. You calculated the impedanceValue by adding the values of 3 bytes but I don't believe this is correct and I also don't see this being done in the 1byoneapp.
- In the 1byone app I see that they use the BMR as the parameter in the bonemass function (this.boneKg = new Bone(peopleModel).getValue(this.BMR);)
- However, manually inserting my BMR value also doesn't lead to the right number so there must still be something else wrong...

Here is a comparison I did where I used my BMR (1764) for the boneMass function. The bonemass value is a bit wrong:

A workaround is to set openscale unit to kg when syncing data, and when you need to look at charts for actual values, manually toggle over to lbs. This thens converts the kg units to lb correctly, but only for old data.

The issue appears that openscale does not support automatic conversion of units from scale (kg) that is different from the user preference (lb).

As an aside, yunmai app is very invasive, but I changed the units of physical scale from kg, to lb to no effect in openscale. It looks like yunmai app recieves kg over bluetooth, even though it displays lb on scale, and lb in yunmai app."

First of all, great work! Love the app.

I've noticed that after a scale sleeps, the app fails to pick up the scale again when it wakes back up. Instead, the user has to manually tap on the Bluetooth icon in the app twice (to turn it off and to turn it back on) to find the scale. Is this normal behaviour or is it a bug? Does the app not automatically search for a new scale on the background after losing the previous connection?

Many thanks for developing openscale. This development was the reason for my buyig the SBF70. At the time of my purchase I did not notice the issues with the SBF 70 - I was happy that is labelled as supported.

Since issue [252](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/issues/252) was closed I am starting here a new issue. I hope this is fine.

I am experiencing problems with the Sanitas SBF70. I am using Android 7.0 Kernel 3.18.31

After going throrugh the different issues in this depository, I started with version 1.7.1 - hoping this would work with the SBF70. 
I could select the scale in the bluetooth settings - and weight readings were retrieved from the scale. No user was created in the balance. No further data were downloaded from the balance.  I stepped on the scale three time with an interval of 1 minute in between.

Then I registered a user with the healthcoach app (after uninstalling openscale)
weight and further reading were  read out from the balance.

I could not obtain any reading with openscale 1.7.1.

Then I changed to the dev version dated 2018-08-20 19:26:52 UTC (obtained from https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/releases). I could choose the sbf 70 from the bluetooth settings. , When try to retrieve any data, I could not get any readings either. Resetting the balanced did not help. 
When trying to retrieve data I did obtain in German something like ""connection established"", and than something like ""connection lost""
I tried in the dev version to create a bt log (https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-G5-Moto-G5-Plus/Bluetooth-BLE-problem-on-moto-G5/m-p/3961770/highlight/true#M18512) and subsequently an error log of openscale.

Can this be fixed?

Scales are sold here in AU at Kmart, the original app worked beautifully just one time.

pretty much has everything you need! I haven't tested any of the user storage functionality (it's way past bed time and sending commands with _nRF Connect_ is very manual, usually resulting in the scales turning off before I can send) but everything in there seems to work with regards to measurements.

Can confirm my device service is `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

Can confirm notifications from `0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` of 8 bytes

**Standard operation**
`FF A5 02 03 04 05 06 07`

`FF` is discarded
`A5` is measurement
`06` Is type

If `06` is `AA` or `A0` then the measurement is weight in KG and lb, `AA` means stable measurement, `A0` unstable measurement.
`02 03` is weight in  100 gram increments (611 is 61.1kg)
`04 05` is weight in lb

**After triggering a fat test**

If `06` is `B0` then the measurement is Fat and Hydration, if it's BE then there was an error

`02 03` is fat in 0.1% increments (218 is 21.8%)
`04 05` is hydration in 0.1% increments (53.5 is 53.5%)

If `06` is `C0` then the measurement is Muscle and Bone

`02 03` is muscle in 0.1% increments (543 is 54.3%)
`05 04` is bone in 0.1% increments (39 is 3.9%) - *nb this is backwards*

If `06` is `D0` then the measurement is calculated calories

`02 03` app lists as amr kcal

If `06` is `E0`, `E1`, `E2`, or `F0` then its related to stored data sets

This could be used for e.g. syncing weight logs to a third-party service such as Google Fit,
without the openScale app having to do so; with this, a 'connector' app could be written that
reads this data and does the push to a third-party service (or, indeed, an HTTP RPC connector,
an MQTT connector, SMS notifications, or anything else) without openScale needing this
functionality (or additional permissions).

This is a straw-man implementation; happy to discuss how you think this should work, if this is a dumb idea altogether and I should abandon it, etc. Really a proof-of-concept as much as anything else. This is, though, basically the approach suggested by oliexdev at https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/issues/82 - ""Another solution is to write for e.g. lets call it ""openScale Connector"" app which listen and access the internal sql database of openScale and send any new data via MQTT or to any company clouds (GARMIN,Google Fit and so on)"", and I think a ContentProvider is the most ""Androidy"" way to do this (and allows locking down this sensitive data behind permissions to prevent malicious apps doing so without user knowledge).

Here's how the flow looks from a dummy third-party app I hacked together which just dumps the data as text:

I used to use a closed-source app before switching to openScale, but I've missed a feature ever since : the ability to display *every* weight value when in year view, and not only each month's first/average/last value (can't even tell which one it is).

Also, while while the graph's scaling (Ymin=min weight value, Ymax=max weight value) allows to more precisely observe weight variations, it makes it harder to see ""the whole picture"".
An option to NOT scale the graph would be highly appreciated (with Ymin =0, and maybe Ymax=max weight, rounded up to the next ten of kilograms)."

In the course of my master thesis I am developing a BLE simulator. We simulate the Bluetooth Low Energy standard and cross-test various mobile health applications to check for their compliance with the BLE standard.

I am pretty sure the simulator is mimicking a default BLE scale as defined per the BLE standardization (https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.service.weight_scale.xml) but still, the openScale application reports it to be not supported.

My question now is: Is this a not yet implemented device, or is my simulator not working properly?
All my tests and cross-checks seem to indicate that the standard is sufficiently simulated, though.

oliexdev/openScale,closed,2018-05-23 18:34:58,Incorrect display/calculation of goal weight and weight difference in statistics screen v1.8.1,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",1,"In version 1.8.x (1.8 and 1.8.1), the goal weight and weight difference are not displayed correctly in the Statistics tab. The first problem is that when using the Imperial system units (lbs, in), regardless of what is entered for user's starting weight and goal weight, the goal weight does not match what is entered in the user profile. This happens regardless of other user profile information (gender, height, etc.). See example below:

Data from user profile:
Initial weight: 200.0 lb
Goal weight: 175.0 lb

Data displayed in statistics tab (no additional measurements)
Goal weight: 79.4 lb
Weight difference: 79.4 lb

Data displayed in statistics tab (measurement at 198 lb added)
Goal weight: 79.4 lb
Weight difference: 118.6 lb

It correctly calculates goal weight but does so with the incorrect goal weight. After putting in a couple different values for goal weights, it looks like what may be happening is that the values may be getting converted to SI units (kg) while still retaining the English label (lbs), i.e. 175.0 lb = 79.4 kg.

The second (minor) issue is that regardless of which unit system is used, the weight difference is not correctly calculated when there are not any measurements entered, i.e. immediately after the user is created but before the first set of measurements is entered. In other words, the app currently displays **weight difference = goal weight** (see above), but instead it should be calculated it as **weight difference = initial weight (from user profile) - goal weight**. Then when a users has entered their first weight value in the app, the formula would change to **weight difference = most recent measured weight - goal weight**.

Also, as an aside, thank you for all the work you are doing on this app - it is a great resource and a very helpful contribution to the open source ecosystem on Android! :) keep up the great work!"

I wanted my Beurer BF700 scale data to be picked up by openScale.
Once installed, I cannot see my scale anywhere - don't I need to identify it in order to select it - like any other BT device ?
And,  on my BF scale I used shortnames, ie Initials of two letters, so I assume the reason for not seeing my data, could be that I cannot add a UserName in openScale with less than 3 letters ! Hence I cannot pick up my measurements !

What would greatly improve my experience is a possibility to show absolute fat and fat-free mass w.r.t. the weight and body fat percentage measurements - not estimated values but just do (weight*percentage/100) and (weight - abs. fat).
So one would obtain this in the graph view:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26491995/39442671-5cdb6c90-4cb2-11e8-91ca-5c869fb3ee3e.png)

For me, these four metrics are the important ones because they show me how my body develops - in the example above i could see at first glance that i may be losing weight, but gaining muscle.


Also cool would be if i could enter the caliper measurements directly in the app and make it calculate the body fat percentage automatically. Right now i have to do it by hand or go on some website. I guess that would mean one more measurement to be enabled via toggle (plus a selection which calculation method should be used) and hard code the formulas (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipometrie#Berechnungsmethoden).
I realize though that i might be the only who would use this, and the current way is fine too.

It is because the Y axis has to spread across all the data points. And weight and body fat are in different data range.
I suggest the graph support a secondary Y axis, So that, the primary and secondary Y axis can have different data range.
User can have option to choose which measurement data reference to which Y axis.

I expected after exporting my details to the default folder created by the app, I should be able to import the file from the folder back to the app for further usage. 

#### Actual behavior
When I tried to import the exported file I get an error message that the file isn't found but when I check my file manager the file is there hence making me unable to import my exported file. 

#### How to reproduce
* Download and open the app.
* create a user and input your details.
* export to the default folder created by the app
* click on import.

Perhaps you could add some text boxes: one to set the servers url and some more boxes to add the links parameters.

1. Open settings, turn on Bluetooth, turn on discoverability, rename device
2. Restart phone
3. Open app, goto settings, bluetooth.
4. Power on device, and whilst standing on scales, click device to search for what looks like a mac address.
5. Step off of scales, go back to home screen in app, and click pair
6. Step on the scales, if it doesn't work, repeat stepping on and off and clicking pair, only after a toast message appears

It's a fantastic app and has saved me from having to send my data to the scale manufacturer app of choice (seemed to include telemetry, a user account requiring online access etc). 

Anything that can be done to improve scanning for Bluetooth devices would be awesome.

Allowing my phone to disconnect from the scales would likewise be great as right now I cannot use bluetooth headphones if my wife wants to weigh herself.

first of all, thanks to all developers of openScale! It's great to see that you are ""freeing"" these devices!

I have some major connection issues with this scale. I had it working twice (and I'm familiar with the setup procedure), but after some time the scale stops to send any values to the smartphone (not even weight). Both devices are connected, and the bluetooth symbol in the LCD turns on and off as expected.

Resetting the scale does not work. This afternoon I had my ""second"" success after connecting the scale to another Android device (a Windows tablet which booted Android-x86 CM 14.1-r1) - I think this helped, but as I said, the problem returned.

I have the feeling that this could be due to other bluetooth devices interfering. Maybe openScale tries to connect to another device in my (really big) apartment building, or the firmware in the scale gets confused by this environment.

I'm using the FDroid build (1.7.1) on a Android 7.0 phone (Wilefox Spark).

I would love to further investigate this - how can I access the app's logs?

Keep up the good work!
Best, Sebastian"

oliexdev/openScale,closed,2018-04-21 08:03:35,New SBF-75 instability on measurements,"[Label(name=""question"")]",0,"## Issue
- SBF-75 does show user name in scale (--- instead) anymore.
- Also, history is not stored anymore. The scale needs to be actively connected to the app while measuring or the measurement will be lost.
- If two users with similar weight ranges are present, measurements might be wrongly associated to a user.
- Registering a profile with a name with the same prefix on two devices appears to cause havoc on the scale.

## Observed behaviour leading to the issue:
- I've tested #205 on a different device (Also Android 7.1.2) using the dev-build given then. For that purpose I've created and connected the app to the scale, that time using a username with a similar 4 letter prefix.
- Measurement as illustrated worked fine on both scales.
- I guess starting with the upgrade 1.7.1 the issues illustrated above appeared. This time on both devices. Maybe the scale has issues handling multiple devices, or the user creation process has issues? Any ideas how to debug this?
  - I've tried to fully reset the scale, however this appeared to have no effect.
  - I've tried to create a new, different, non-prefix similar user and have it registered, and shown on measurements, however to no avail.
- This might also include issues with non-weight-only measurements.

I'd be happy to get any insight or ideas on how to debug this, as the state before this was very nice and stable.  "

1. Remove any existing user from `openScale`
2. Completely remove the legacy SBF70 app (health coach)
3. Reset the scale with the button, until I see `DEL` on the display. 
4. Open the `openScale` app and add a new user
5. Open bluetooth settings and connect to SBF70, selected `search for scale at startup` and `automaticaly assign user`.
6. Bluetooth connection is established and it starts measuring.
7. At the end, only the weight appears on the SBF70 display and in `openScale` table.

- Daily use of one of the supported BTLE scales using them to measure whatever they provide. (Schedule A)
- Weekly or less than daily measurement of other manual metrics such as e.g. waist size (Schedule B) 
- I would like to have the current measurement of schedule B to be carried over / applied to measurements of Schedule A until the next measurement of schedule B is available.
- Thus, all records would have data for automatic and manual measurements present. 

# Rationale / Current state
- Currently I have to generate a new measurement that gets the latest automatic / schedule A measurements and add my manual measurements.
- Upon looking at the diagrams this leads to wrong / weird display of data as it appears that the 0 entries for the additional / manual measurements on schedule A records are included in the diagramming / calculation process leading to wrong / undesirable results."

I have trouble with getting body fat readings. I read the FAQ, tried resetting the scale - it did not work. My hypothesis is that the initialization is not working properly. I am using v1.7 (23) installed via F-Droid.

Workaround: When I used the Sanitas HealthCoach app to initialize the scale and add the user, I received body fat readings.

Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that the user initialization is not working properly, but that is only a vague assumption based on the workaround and a quick glance at the log files. [sbf70log.txt](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/files/1708524/sbf70log.txt)

thanks for the app. I'm using **Version:** 1.7 (23) via the f-droid store.

Just some workflow changes to make manual entries easier.

- Choose in what order the data has to be entried.
- Add option to automatically open the next entrie field.

**Explanation:**
My scale does show the data pretty fast and has now bluetooth. So i have to look for the data, press the ""Add"" button, entry the data, press ""Ok"", search the next ""Add"" button, and so on.
It would be much easier if i could just ""Start Entry"" - write data - ""OK"" - write next data - ""OK"" - finished

just want   

* a good scale, which is 
* sufficiently accurate, and which 
* has a good app.

When checking all scales apps, I was *really* happy to find your App ""openScale"". Great that you go through the effort of freeing that type of hardware, much much appreciated.  Also I assume many of the other apps force us to store stuff in the cloud, and I don't want that.

Some app ratings:  

4.2 openScale  
2.8 Medisana VitaDock+  
2.7 renpho  
2.6 Yolanda (marsboy, AnGeer)
2.5 New iwellness (hamswan?)
2.4 1byone wellness 2.0  
which other apps are out there?

## choose hardware 

Now ... as I have not yet bought the scale ... **which one do you recommend**?

At the moment your wiki (is it uptodat?) looks as if everything is pointing to the [Medisana BS444](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/wiki/Supported-scales-in-openScale); because you have a dedicated page for that one (and the only other one, Xiaomi, is not yet fully freed); and the Medisana has no warnings in the table (apart from n/a not applicable -  *why* is that not appilicable here?).

The Medisana gets 3.3 out of 5.0 points from 383 customers ([DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01DPJSOT6/), none in [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DPJSOT6)), and [21% disappointed](https://www.amazon.de/product-reviews/B01DPJSOT6/ref=cm_cr_dp_hist_one?filterByStar=one_star) people talk about the drawbacks.

I don't want to **buy** on Amazon - but the ratings (are sometimes manipulated yes, but) help to avoid totally crappy products - and after choosing, then I can buy locally, not from the devil. 

Some (rather randomly selected) scales:

* Marsboy - not many [disappointed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01N99NODP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - ""Amazon's choice""
* AnGeer - very few [disappointed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B06W54P7M7/ref=acr_dpx_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - (actually 87% happy could mean manipulated?)
* Hamswan - [still very few opinions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B074CGC4LJ), unclear which app to use - ""Amazon's choice""
* 1byone - [many many reviews](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01FHF9DOQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - ""Amazon's choice""
* Omron [BF508](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0033AGBVG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) and [BF511](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0033AGBVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) do not mention Bluetooth? 

That handle for the hands ... looks like it makes a lot of sense to measure visceral fat.

**Important:** But if the scale is not supported by your app, I don't want it.


Here are lists of popular scales:

* https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?keywords=body%20fat%20scales
* https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?keywords=body%20fat%20scales%20android

I've just started to use openScale to get my measurement data from my Sanitas SB70 (I had been using Sanitas HealthCoach app quite successfully (surprising I know!) for a number of months, but recently it stopped communicating; might be related to the Fitbit app recently installed?).

So I've got openScale talking to the scales ok, but it operates slightly differently from HealthCoach. I've tried looking through all the FAQs etc for info, but couldn't find anything that helped.

â€¢ It hasn't downloaded the history of measurements that were left in the scale since the last successful sync with HealthCoach, is that correct/expected behaviour?
â€¢ The data sync only seems to work at the time I weigh myself; if I try the data sync some time after, it doesn't load the most recent measurement, is that expected?
â€¢ I've exported all my data from HealthCoach to Excel. Looking at various comments, it would seem I need to use the latest dev/beta build to be able to successfully import those, is that correct? If so, will that delete the most recent measurements in openScale or do I need to export those first, combine with the HealthCoach data and import it all back in?

Despite the questions, just want to say thanks for developing this app, it looks good and means I don't have to throw away the scales! (Once I've used and got know it a bit more I'll stick a rating on Play store)."

First, thanks a lot for your libre / free app :-) Since January 1st I've noticed there is a bug is the overview graph. We're in 2018, data points from the current year are correctly displayed like ""3 days ago"", but data points from December 2017 are said to be ""343 days ago"" or something similar.

I guess it's a pretty easy bug to fix. If you're OK with that, and if you leave me some time for it I'd love to work on it and fix it. It's not a critical bug and the app works well otherwise. If I would fix it, I would only fix the computation, nothing else.

But with multiple users it's having some difficulties. Regardless on what 'profile' I set the app to, according to the SBF75 it keeps showing the first added user, rather than my own.

So For example, I have 2 users called Demo 1 and Demo 2.

Sometimes its saving the data on the proper account (Demo 2 on the app, Demo 1 on the device, but writes the data to Demo 2 on the app). 

And sometimes using Demo 2 on the app, showing Demo 1 on the device but writes the data to Demo 1 on the app instead.

The SBF75 also starts with no name, as such i have to stand on it to get a clue which name it is choosing. Not sure if this is related to the device itself, or the name is not being transferred correctly from the app to the device to show the proper name.

Any clue to why this is happening?"

This way the base class MeasurementView can be cleaned up as much code is moved to FloatMeasurementView where it can deal with the value in a more explicit way as it is always float there.

The second part of this involves changing the DataEntryActivity to not save measurements to the database when navigating between them unless they have been modified. This improves the performance when switching between measurements. I have some more things I would like to do in this area, such as changing how the active user is handled, but that is for later.

DataEntryActivity now holds on to a clone of the ScaleMeasurement it is displaying, which makes it easier to update when something changes and cascade the changes to the other views.

Other performance improvements includes not updating the views unless the value has changed and using SpannableStringBuilder instead of Html.fromHtml to style text (only in MeasurementView, not yet in TableFragment)."

For BMI one uses age and sex instead of the simplified version which considers normal everything between 18.5 and 24.99.
For weight, however, one just assumes that normal BMI is between 20 and 25 (for men) and from it and the heigth it derives the normal weight.  For ages>40 or ages<20 this leads to inconsistencies (one could be overweight according to weight and underweight according to BMI). The assumed variation of ""normal"" BMI with age is probably  too agressive. Probably one should set the correct BMI limits first and from them derive the correct weight limits.

Below some suggestions to improve the french translations:
- For harmonization purpose, I suggest you to change ""Taux de graisse corporelle"" by ""Pourcentage de graisse corporelle""
- you can translate ""Bone mass"" by ""Masse osseuse""
- You can translate ""Basal metabolic rate"" by ""Taux mÃ©tabolique basal (BMR)"" (keep BMR into brackets as it's also commonly used in France).

My scale is also giving the Visceral fat (graisse viscÃ©rale). Don't know if it's relevant for open scale (kind of indicator between 0 to 60). Look at https://tanita.eu/tanita-academy/understanding-your-measurements

I already found out the weight values but I can't figure out the body fat percentage, muscle percentage and so on. Any help or idea is welcome.

So far what I got:

- No weight values are stored on the scale itself. You have to be connected to the yunmai app to receive any data
- Weights are continuous send to UUID: Unknown (0xffe4) (if you stay on the scale)
- Sent values are like `0d:1f:0b:01:59:c6:15:2f:26:95:03`
  * byte 0-6: bytes are constant
  * byte 7: first nibble is constant, second nibble is changing
  * byte 8-9: contains the weight value (here `0x2695` = 9877 = 98,77 btw the value is rounded in the yunmai app as 98,8 kg)
  * byte 10: is changing
- last measurement from the scale of the continuous sent send data looks like `0d:1f:14:02:00:59:c6:15:2f:23:d0:b6:32:26:95:00:a5:08:f2:37`
  * byte 0-5: bytes are constant
  * byte 6: first nibble is constant, second nibble is changing
  * byte 7-8: bytes are changing
  * byte 9-12: bytes are constant
  * byte 13-14: contains the weight value again
  * byte 15: bytes are constant
  * byte 16-19: bytes are changing
- after that the yunmai app send some values to the scale. In response they send some values back to the scale like the following `0d:1f:12:06:01:23:d0:b6:32:af:01:19:55:5a:8d:26:01:6f`
-  I guess that the values displayed in the yunmai app are rounded values like as the weight value
- Since so many bytes are constant and only few bytes are changing it could be possible that the information of the body measurements (like fat, muscle, water percentage etc.) are compressed or somehow encrypted. (for example a fat percentage of 22,9 % is somehow in the above values encoded)

Here are my Bluetooth log files with the corresponding body measurements which we have to find (open it with wireshark):

I would also like to have an option to set the diagram on the overview page to 'average per day' values. This would lead to one point per day.

If you use your scale with more than one person you have to set additional openScale user(s) to use the smart assignment for filtering away unwanted measurements.

But when you initially sync your MiScale, ALL stored values are synced to the currently active openScale user and you have to manually delete A LOT OF measurements after that. I tried it with two users but I don't know what do do if there are more family members using the scale.

Is there another (less time-consuming) way to assign the values to the users? Our scale is almost two months in use and I had to delete virtually hundreds of values. What happens if one installs openscale and there are thousands of values stored on the family scale? ... 
There must be a better way to achieve this separation... (multiple cut paste for example, or selecting and moving all values in a specified weight range).

The current behavior works but it can be extremely exhausting for new openScale users to sync their scale if their family used the MiScale for months/years before.

I think MiFit simply ignores all old values when you register a new user and asks you to step on the scale to 'connect' your user to the right weight range. In fact the users of MiFit even don't know that their scale provides a history of old values. I think most of them would be satisfied if openScale behaves like MiFit in this point - at least as the default.

edit
Idea: When a user tries to sync his MiScale to an 'empty openScale user"", openScale could ask him to step on the scale and after that press ok. Then openScale could do the sync and discard all but the last value. In future syncs only fitting measurements younger than the initial sync could be added to this openScale user. This would mimic the MiFit behavior."

currently I'm on openScale 1.5.2 (via F-Droid) and have the following problems.
My wife and me have two phones. On every phone we have two openScale users to use the smart assignment function of openScale.

In the morning we both stepped on our MiScale (me at 6:15 am, my wife at 6:45am). After breakfast (~ 7:30 am) we tried to sync our phones to get the new values. But unfortunately only my wife got the two new values. It seems like only the first phone that syncs gets all the measurements and after that they are gone. To check this behavior I stepped on the scale again and after that my own phone was able to receive this fresh measurement. But when I synced with my wifes phone after that, there were no new measurements again.

I also tried to remove the batteries of the Scale. Then I synced the Scale with my wifes phone and got a lot of very old measurements (as expected). But when I synced with my own phone after that, there were no measurements again. I had no more time to check but I bet that if I reset the batteries again and then do the initial sync with my phone, my phone will get all the old values.

I checked both users on both phones. At this time both phones have a complete disjunct set of measurements.
This behavior is not very practical for using the scale with more than one person - as most families do.

I think this could be an side effect of the fixed time bug. Would you please try to find a better multi user solution?

first I want to thank you for this great app. Me and my wife also don't like to push our personal data to the cloud. When I found your app, I decided to order a Mi Scale for us.

But now we have headaches with the dates of the measurements. Me and my wife use two phones with openScale (1.5) to track our weight. On both phones we first created two accounts in openScale. Then we did some test measurements and synced our phones to the scale. We had to delete some of the first values on each phone because they went to the wrong user, but despite of that everything went fine.

But when we used the scale again two days later, all new synced values got dates and times of our test measurements, or maybe the date of an deleted test measurement. So we took out the batteries of the scale and reinstalled openScale and took some test measurements but the next day the same thing happened. All new measurements get the date and of one of the test measurements. Deleting some or all measurements in openScale also didn't help.

I mentioned the fw version because I think that this could be the root of our problems. When we got the scale, I first connected it to Mi Fit and after a break of a minute or two Mi Fit displayed the firmware of the scale as ""v0.5.8"". Mi Fit didn't mention any update process but perhaps it had silently updated the scales firmware. I think so, because when you connect a Mi Band it gets updated as well. And new fw versions often lead to problems with Gadgetbridge, an open source app for mi band sync (see https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Mi-Band-Firmware-Information).

Could anyone please try to sync his Scale to Mi Fit and report back, what firmware version is displayed? And then check again, if syncing to openScale shows the right dates for new measurements. Perhaps Xiaomi changed the transmission protocol ...

And another question:
- How many measurements are stored in the scale and transmitted as history when you sync? And are the transmitted measurements deleted after that? (the openScale wiki is not clear about that) I ask because we want to use our two phones alternating and don't want to miss weights on each of them. And we don't want to take the ""live"" weight holding our phones in the bathroom. Instead we would like to use the history to sync our measurements every day or two. Is this possible?

Like you, I have been very frustrated by the lack of ""non-cloud"" smart devices. I would like to buy a scale to use with your app but, unfortunately, I am not technically savvy enough to understand your engineering notes. Could you please consider adding a section at the Wiki page for each hardware device to clearly outline how well it is supported by the app? The app page says Xiaomi is supported, but is it really fully supported? I would like to make sure before buying one.

Also, I would be happy to buy through your Amazon affiliate link, or something similar, if you have one. If you do not have one, it might be worth setting up. I think I am not the only person who would like to give back for your work.

You might also consider creating an email account for personal contact. Just an idea. I don't know if GitHub has a built in messaging service but I would recommend email anyway."

its great to see someone creates open source apps that save your privacy for products that want to share everything with the cloud. Thank you.

I bought the Mi Scale, downloaded your app Open Scale (v1.4.3) from F-Droid with a LG G4 with Cyanogenmod 13 (Android 6.0.1) and tried to connect it to the scale. I also deactived the privacy features for this app. Only the firewall (Afwall) is activated.

Often it works and I can receive the values from the scale. But more often the app crashes. Sometimes immediately after the start and sometimes after I tap on the bluetooth Symbol within the app.

Then it works for quite a few times and after a while it is broken again --> crash after trying to connect.

Maybe there is a problem if I start the app when I am standing on the scale already and the scale is still changing the weight quickly.

I can not locate the problem in detail but maybe you experienced similar things. 

How does the app handle BLE-information that it does not understand? Does it ignore it or might this be the reason for the crash? Maybe you could catch errors within the app?

Best regards

I'd like to mention that the scale you use while building charts (starting from 0) isn't the best solution. This results in almost straight line, especially on small screen of a smartphone. This makes the chart completely useless. No one will weight 0 or 10 or 20 (even 60 for me personally) kilos. And there's no need to use this values while building charts. The better way is to take upper and lower results, add some margin (say, 2-5 kg) and use the resulting scale. Or use target weight as lower bound.

Also, in a year chart there's no need to reserve the scale up to end of the year. Doing so in January we will get almost blank screen. X-line should have 1st of January as 0 and the current date (plus some margin, say, one week) as its right bound.

And the last, putting all the values on a chart isn't a good idea when you have many records. Better not to put at all (or have a setting to put or not) or put only for peak values.

Look what I have in openScale and other similar program with exactly the same data:
