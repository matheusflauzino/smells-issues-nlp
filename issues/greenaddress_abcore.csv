greenaddress/abcore,open,,Battery optimization fix wip issue 51,[],0,"So this is working code to give you an idea of what the user will be required to do. At the moment the dialog will pop up as soon as the user has set the switch to download Core.

This is probably NOT what I would recommend - if the user is using an Android device that is left plugged in, there is no need for this fix, as Doze is not supposed to activate when plugged in ( there are some phones which ignore this, for no particular rhyme or reason). I would recommend either:
a) another toggle under the ""On / Off Switch"" on Main Activity, or
b) add it as an option in the settings menu.

It depends where we want to educate the user I guess. They might not find it in the settings, but cluttering the MainActivity UI/UX is rarely a good idea.

I am happy to implement either, just let me know what you prefer."

greenaddress/abcore,open,,Improve F-Droid listing,[],0,"I've seen this app on F-Droid, but it lacks screenshots, changelog and a translatable description there.

After you have commited these files to your repo and tagged a new version, you need to remove the `Description` and `Summary` from the metadata file in the [F-Droid Data repo](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata)."
greenaddress/abcore,open,,Battery optimization on Android 8.0 prevents ABCore from syncing,[],0,"Android 8.0 has introduced a battery optimization change that creates limits on how freely apps running in background can access to the device's resources. This prevents ABCore and other apps connected to the Bitcoin network from syncing the blocks when the app is running in background.

Luckily this can be solved by going to ""Special app access"" in the device's settings and deactivate the battery optimization feature for individual apps.

Since if not addressed this prevents the users from being able to use the app, I suggest to at least put a helper message somewhere to guide users in deactivating the battery optimization for ABCore.

As a reference: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes

I also reported the same issue to the Andorid Bitcoin-wallet devs and seems like their plan is to rewrite the background process to use WorkManager: https://github.com/bitcoin-wallet/bitcoin-wallet/issues/557#issuecomment-420707493"

greenaddress/abcore,closed,2016-11-07 07:31:24,ABCore randomly restarting,[],0,"This is a problem I've been having for several releases, including the latest (0.48).

After stopping Core (by pressing the slider/button ""Switch Core OFF""), and verifying that it indeed has stopped (debug.log shows ""Shutdown: done""), the tray icon disappears. I leave the ABCore app, and remove it from the view of recently used apps (pressing the square button, and swiping the ABCore window off the screen).

Some time later (I think usually when leaving another, unrelated app), the ABCore tray icon automatically reappears, and it seems that it indeed is running again (by inspecting the debug.log). This makes it nearly unusable, as the memory/CPU/bandwidth usage is something I don't want to see appear unexpectedly.

The problem does not seem to occur if after stopping Core, and leaving ABCore, I go to the apps settings screen, and Force Kill the application.

I don't have the feature for automatically running when on power+wifi enabled.

Options:

1) Possible solution:
Use http://proot.me/ a user space chroot mechanism and setup /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts

2) Faster/hacky solution:
Use glibc HOSTALIASES env var to pass an arbitrary hosts file ( http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gethostbyname.3.html )

Either way if the hosts file is used it needs to be generated at run time by resolving the dns servers just before starting the node

3) Preferred solution: reimplement it properly:
Compile Core using the Android NDK, this should reduce the binary size (and it's dependencies) but it will require building and hosting various architectures just for Android.
