I found [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.swagselfie.locationshare) on the Google Play Store. This guy just took your source code, added some ads in it and put it on the Store, without warning this is free software...

As you are the owner of the source code, feel free to open a request to google [here](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googleplay) to remove this copy from the Store, if it's your wish ;)

Don't forget to tell Google that:

* The app is licensed under GNU GPL v3 license and this guy is violating it;
* He is falsely claiming he made the app;
* Provide some screenshots of your own app."

There is 1 install of the app on Android 4.3 (sdk 18) and nothing below it. Since there are no stats for F-Droid or people who built from source, I can't be sure that some other users aren't below that, but I would think that using a minsdk of 14 would be fine at this point. This would only exclude Gingerbread and Honeycomb which are really old at this point.

This would allow for using the most recent version of the appcompat library as well as cleaning up some of the shims for older versions."

I do have one feature request.  When you are prompted to choose a link type, could there be a check box to remember this selection and then not have to answer each time?

Thanks
