icechen1/Notable,open,,Feature Request: Would it be possible to close instead of minimize the app after adding a new note?,[],0,"The only issue I have with Notable is that after I add a new note Notable will minimize itself instead of closing completely. If I press the Overview button the Notable window will still appear in the list and I will need to manually swipe it to close the app for good and get it out of the way. 

Is this something that could be fixed?

I'm using NotablePlus x1.5.8 (installed from F-Droid) on LineageOS 14.1

icechen1/Notable,open,,Feature Request: Priority based on color,[],0,"As of now the notification priority can be set generally to normal, low or minimum. Also, there's four different colors for the notification icon.

It would be nice to have an option to tie those colors to different priorities. (Alternatively there could be a separate priority setting when creating notes. But I think my idea would keep it simple.)

icechen1/Notable,open,,Feature Request: Setting alarm to appear later,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"I love the app. I think it would be very useful to be able to offer the option in the configuration options that when you set an alarm the notification will only appear at the time of that alarm. Thiis way, you could for instance write down to turn off the oven, and the notification would only appear at the time you wanted, not having it all the time there when there is no use and only taking up a precious space.

icechen1/Notable,closed,2013-09-22 02:01:49,"Remove automatic second line, fix a crash, a little refactoring",[],0,"Hi, first of all thanks for the app :)
I made this pull request because I though adding ""Notable"" as a second line to single-line notifications was a bit irritating so I removed it. If you had a special reason for adding that second line, maybe we can discuss a better way to do that.
Also, I fixed a crash in the following case. Create a reminder, then click the notification to open its detail view, dismiss the reminder, then go to Recent Apps and click Notable. The app crashes because it tries to open a detail view for a reminder that has already been deleted.
Finally, I made a little refactoring, most important of which is making the Notable app inherit the library's manifest instead of copying it. It has a small downside that ADT doesn't find the launcher activity (which is its bug) so when you launch the app from Eclipse, it just installs it but doesn't launch it. I think this is an acceptable price for not having to duplicate every change that you make to the library's manifest.
Looking forward to getting these changes as an update from Play :)
