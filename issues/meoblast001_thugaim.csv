meoblast001/thugaim,open,,Change controls,[],0,"It is very difficult to control the spaceship, for now I'm just hold the phone in 90Â° and touch the screen until no enemy is left ;-)

But seriously, there's actually no way you can focus on anything that's moving if you have to rethink the controls every 0.5 seconds.

My suggestion is to invert the envrioment: instead of the spaceship moving in the space, the world should be moving around the spaceship, this would make the control much easier."
