To: Owner of Android app android-app://es.esy.CosyDVR/.

Google systems have detected that some of the deep links you provided for your app pages fail to launch the app. This can be confusing and frustrating for users, because they won’t be able to open the content they wanted within your app from Google search results. Therefore, we will not show deep links to these app pages in our mobile search results.

Here's how you can fix this:

1	
Check which app pages have this issue
Review the list of example pages where we observed this issue in the Search Console Crawl Status report.
See error examples
2	
Check your Android manifest file
Make sure your Android manifest file supports deep links.
3	
Use the error examples to understand the problem
Make sure the format and spelling of your deep links is correct.
See correct format
4	
Fix the issue and verify the fix
Test each deep link on your attached device or emulator to make sure it launches your app.
5	
Publish the updated APK in the Play Store
Once we recrawl and reprocess your app pages, the errors will disappear from Search Console.
Need more help?

•	Find out more about how to change your Android manifest file and the correct format of app deep links on our Developer site.

Hello Google Play Developer,

Our records show that your app, CosyDVR, with package name es.esy.CosyDVR, currently violates our User Data policy regarding Personal and Sensitive Information.

Policy issue: Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information. Your app requests sensitive permissions (e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data, but does not include a valid privacy policy.

Action required: Include a link to a valid privacy policy on your app's Store Listing page and within your app. You can find more information in our help center.

Alternatively, you may opt-out of this requirement by removing any requests for sensitive permissions or user data.

If you have additional apps in your catalog, please make sure they are compliant with our Prominent Disclosure requirements.

Please resolve this issue by March 15, 2017, or administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of your app, up to and including removal from the Play Store. Thanks for helping us provide a clear and transparent experience for Google Play users.

Regards,

The Google Play Team"
