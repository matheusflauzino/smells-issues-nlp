I've updated to v1.8.1 today. Now I can't install the latest or stable build. I'm using LineageOS 14.1, Android couldn't parse the downloaded package. Is there anything I could try or is Android 7.x no longer supported by Chromium Dev Builds?

adolfintel/chromiumUpdater,closed,2018-01-29 19:23:16,New icon ?,[],0,"I would like to propose you some new icons for your app. Simply because the current icons in fdroid is really ugly IMO.
I saw you had to change the icons already because of the google policy right ?
Could you tell me more about this ?

I already [created some icons](https://github.com/jooola/chromiumUpdater/tree/master/contrib), just tell me if you like it , if we can use it ( google policy ? ) and if you want to tweak some details.
They all are SVG's so changing something would be really easy !
I used [the old chromium 11 SVG](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_11_Logo.svg) as base, and added on top of it the [sync icons from material icons](https://material.io/icons/#ic_sync).

I can also use a different icon like a down arrow or something, instead of the sync icon !

I'll push a PR once we find the right icon !"

First thank you for this development...

1- Why you don't add the chromium-apk directly to f-droid. So we can directly download the app from f-droid like other apps.

2- There is another android app for same purpose: https://github.com/andDevW/getChromium You know what is the difference with your app?

Thanks in advance..."
