I can see notification with ""Touch to show/hide window'  that changes when touched but  I don't see the window no matter what the notification says (hide or show). Any tip what is wrong and how to troubleshoot this?

BTW normal (non floating) termux works fine of course."

termux/termux-float,open,,feature request: option to customize transparency?,[],0,"Hi, I think it would be really useful if you could customize the transparency of the floating widget. 
The easiest way would probably be to ""mis""use the volume-down-button together with some keyboard letter(s) for that (again), I guess. The volume-down button gets already used as CTRL-key; so e.g.: 
CTRL-PLUS to increase transparency and
CTRL-MINUS to decrease transparency. 
Or any other similar key.

You can paste into normal termux by long press. 
Is there any functionality to paste to floating window Termux?
