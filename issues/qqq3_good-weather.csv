qqq3/good-weather,open,,crash when searching after setting 'update location' to true on android 19,[],0,"I am now using good weather, however, these days i found a reproducible crash:
1.get into the 'widget setting' page, and set 'update locating' to true;
2.get into search page, and type in hint words like 'london';
3.select one from the list, and then the crash happens.

the good weather verison is 4.4, which was downloaded from f-droid;
the device I use is an avd from android studio, android sdk version is 19(4.4), cpu is x86, device type is nexus S;
would you please confirm it  for me ?"
qqq3/good-weather,open,,Translation,[],0,"Hi,

I've noticed that my language is not in the list of available language listed in ""settings"" but it is actually translated, as stated here:
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/good-weather/strings/

Is there any way to set it up?

Thanks"
qqq3/good-weather,open,,Proposal,[],0,"First of all I would like to say thank you for this great app, I use it every day.
I miss a simple feature which have a lot of other weather App: the possibility to switch the view (current/charts/forecast) with just sliding the finger to the left or to the right of the screen. This would make the program use more comfortable and easier to use.

The program could also show a couple of arrows beside each data, in order to show the up/down trend (temperature, humidity, wind)."
qqq3/good-weather,open,,Logo Proposal,[],0,"It's been awhile since your last update, so I think we should put some beauty on the Project. How about creating a new logo and banner for it ?"
qqq3/good-weather,open,,"An error occurred on the ""Refresh icon"" that caused the Crash app",[],0,"#### Expected behavior
Supposedly, When the user presses <code>""Refresh icon""</code> more than once on the <code>""Daily Forecast""</code> menu, the application will not crash.

#### Actual behavior
At first I did not think it really caused the application to stop. But when I did refresh more than once, the application suddenly happened Crash. That's why I tried to find the error and I found it.

When a user presses <code>""Refresh icon""</code> more than once quickly, on the <code>""Daily Estimates""</code> menu, the app will be paralyzed.

#### How to reproduce
1. Instal App [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ATA_Droid.WeatherForecastRadar)
2. Sign in ""Feature Forecast Daily"", Click on ""Refresh icon"" more than once quickly. Then the application will crash.

I found [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.RoyalBlue.goodweather) on the Google Play Store. This guy just took your source code, added some ads in it and put it on the Store, without warning this is free software...

As you are the owner of the source code, feel free to open a request to google [here](https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googleplay) to remove the false app from the Store, if it's your wish ;)

Don't forget to tell Google that:

* The app is licensed under GNU GPL v3 license and this guy is violating it;
* He is falsely claiming he made the app...

Maybe you should take some time (one hour or something so) to check the other apps about weather information on Google Play Store, and report them to Google. I think some of them are just ""Good Weather"" with ads in it, and without GNU GPL, code source and your permission... If you do it, please copy-paste the links of the apps you reported in this thread, so that I can track the ""Google developers"" who are stealing your work. Thanks

qqq3/good-weather,open,,Add Support To Track Multiple Cities,[],0,"I need to track the weather in multiple cities.

This app could have an editable list inside of it (in the search area) of recent cities searched so I could quickly find my city again.

I would like a section to display of the weather of multiple cites in rows.

Also, when I choose the widget I would like it to ask me which city then keep THAT city in THAT widget. Then I could create multiple widgets with different cities.

The app ""World Clock"" used to do this. I am really sad it is now broken. You might want to look at their code:

qqq3/good-weather,open,,crash during search,[],0,"1) create 3x1 widget - widget reads ""London""
2) tap widget to open app and tap geo icon
3) app waits for location but never returns because it can't find a gps signal
4) in the task manager, close good weather with the ""X""
5) tap on the widget to reopen good weather and tap on the search icon
6) begin typing any city name - search activity crashes
7) try again - it crashes every time.
8) do something else (like submit a bug report)
9) come back to the app and try searching - this time it works"

qqq3/good-weather,closed,2017-04-18 13:28:15,Widget becomes transparent and unclickable,[],0,"Running Good Weather on Android 7.1 (Nitrogen OS on Oneplus One).
The widget becomes unclickable and transparent every now and then. See the attached screenshot.

I must admit though, that I prefer the transparent outlook, eventhough it is a 
bug. So I made also an enhancement suggestion. Would be nice to see this without the colored bar.

I got interessted in this app and while browsing through the code and running it with German localization (since I'm German), some translation issues appeared and I corrected them and reordered the translation strings analogue to the default string.xlm for comparability and maintenance.

If the corrections are ok for you, would you like to pull them in?

qqq3/good-weather,closed,2016-12-08 06:37:49,Feature request: add option to disable weather description,[],0,"Hi! First of all, thank you for your great app, it works very well and is visually beautiful.

I'm not reporting an issue but a doing a feature request. When a language is not supported by openweathermap, it returns the weather description in english. It's not a big problem, but most of the time, the weather icon gives enough information about the weather. So my proposal is to add and option in the settings to allow hiding the description, both from the main screen and from the widget.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day :-)"
