First of all, thank you to you and to all the contributors of Emeral for this awesome, easy to use and minimalistic launcher. Well, I wanted to contribute to this project with a new translation to Spanish.

I translated all the files I understand they are translatable, because there are another files without text to translate. The files translated are:

- `arrays.xml`
- `cwac_colormixer_strings.xml`
- `strings.xml`

I have one suggestion too: why the last string in `strings.xml` is untranslatable? It is easy to translate and if we translate it we could make easier to share with everyone the contributions of each one and  to encourage users to ""Want to help? Report bugs and submit suggestions via..."". What do you think about it?"

HenriDellal/emerald,closed,2018-10-04 13:16:43,Migrate launcher's data to SQLiteDatabase,[],0,"﻿The introducing of shortcuts has required the change of the data storing method. Starting from 0.6.0, the launcher will store some data in tables (apps, shortcuts and categories) of the database. There is the only thing left to do before 0.6.0: convert all data from previous versions of the launcher to the newest.

Old structure:
- All apps are stored in .MyCache.
- Every custom category has its *.cat file with the list of apps' activities(just like in .MyCache)
- There is categories.props file to store the list of hidden categories.

New structure:
- Apps are in ""apps"" table, their categories are listed in ""categories"" field of the app entry.
- List of custom categories is stored in ""categories"" table.

The suggested algorithm is:
[ ] Get all category names from filenames and store them in categories table.
[x] Convert .MyCache data to apps table.
[x] Delete .MyCache file.
[ ] For each category file (*.cat): open file, go through it and if application from this file exists, add category to this application entry in apps table, then close and delete the file.
[x] Get hidden categories from categories.props, store them in preferences, then delete the file."

ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md
* build-emerald.sh
* icon.svg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted

After the Emerald settings disappears from the Android recents screen, there's no way to get to the settings anymore.

Proposed solution: add a menu button (three dots vertical) to the Android navigation bar. As this would not work on devices with hardware buttons, also or instead add the option to open the popup menu by long pressing the home or back button, or long-pressing on empty space in between icons.

On my device, the following apps have icon missing: AnySoftKeyboard, Contacts, Firefox Klar, PDF Viewer, Settings. All other apps are drawn correctly. Anything specific about these apps?

P.S. Thank you for your work! I've already replaced ""Hayai"" launcher with Emerald, which seems to be an improvement.:)"

The other option is to show the favourite apps after pressing the menu button(both on-screen and device), that is similar to KISS Launcher circle behaviour."
