j4velin/Pedometer,closed,2018-11-15 21:26:34,Android System thinks pedometer is running in the foreground,[],0,"I'm running LineageOS 15.1, Android 8.1. I updated Pedometer from v1.5.6 to v1.5.8 today. The change log of v1.5.8 reads ""add settings shortcut to notification settings on Android 8+"". Now in the settings of pedometer there is a ""Notification settings"" option, I click on this option and it will jump to the system notification settings of pedometer. 

Now the problem is, if I turn off the notification of Pedometer, the Android System will show a notification saying that ""Pedometer is using battery"". And in the battery usage information of Pedometer, the ""While in background"" entry is 0 minute, the ‚ÄúWhile in active use"" entry equals the time I unplug my phone after full charge. That is to say, though pedometer is actually running in the background, the Android System thinks Pedometer is running in the foreground (in active use) and pop up a notification notifying me of that.

I downgrade to v1.5.6 and the issue is gone. Now Pedometer is being deemed by the Android System as being running in the background again, and the ""While in background"" entry starts to grow normally. No notification of ""Pedometer is using battery"" any more. In the settings of v1.5.6, the ""Show notification"" is a check box, instead of an option that will direct me to the system notification settings of Android 8.1.

j4velin/Pedometer,open,,App occasionally records approximately 10x actual steps for a day,[],0,"I've been using the app for a couple of months now, and generally it works great, thank you! However, in my first week of using it and again just yesterday I had one day show up with something like 200k (not 2 million, as in one of the closed issues) steps, when I probably did about 10k. This is on a Blackberry Priv, for what it's worth. I don't have any reliable way to reproduce this, unfortunately. I didn't to the best of my knowledge do any unusual activities on the two days when this happened.

It would be nice if I could at least discard these days from my statistics, either automatically or via some kind of manual process. Perhaps there could be a user-settable cap and the number of steps per day is never allowed to be recorded as more than that? Or (more difficult, I'm sure) perhaps the average number of steps per second between readings of the hardware step counter could be calculated, and if it shows a rate above some value the reading is discarded.

If there's anything I can do to help debug this problem please let me know, and thanks very much for making the app available in the first place!"

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,2017-12-21 20:35:08,Behaviour change of AlarmManager.set() since API 19,[],0,"Hi,

I have noticed that in SensorListener.java API [AlarmManager.set(int, long, PendingIntent)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#set(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) is used to schedule services to save the step count and restart sensor services.

According to the document, after API 19, the scheduled event will not be triggered immediately at the scheduled time and will be delayed by the operating system. After API 19, new API like setExact() and setWindow() were introduced to trigger the tasks in time.

I think it would be especially important to not use the old API when restart the sensor service. Hope this information can help.

Thx."

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,2017-08-23 19:15:35,"When restoring from backup, overwrite existing days instead of skipping them",[],0,"Hello!

First, I love this app and I have been using it for more than a year. I like its approach of only using hardware step sensor so that it consumes no battery while still measuring steps.

I had almost no problems with it, until recently that when my device unexpectedly shutdowns, after starting up it shows an abnormal number of steps for the current day (hundreds of thousands and even millions!). It might be an old version bug, as I was running version 1.5 (I installed it through f-droid and I forgot to update it) and I have seen in the code that the unexpected shutdown recovery logic has recently been changed (it no longer displays a notification).

So, in order to remove those false step measurements, I thought to make a backup, modify the wrong step counts and then re-import it. While doing so, I realized that if the database already had data for a day in the backup file, the day was skipped from restore, favoring local database over backup.

So, I propose this change to make backup files take precedence over local data, so that we can modify the stored steps for a day without having to uninstall and the reinstall the app, loosing widgets, shortcuts and settings.

With my proposed change, when restoring data from a backup file, if the given day is already on the database, it is updated with the steps from the backup file. If it does not exists, it is created as before. I have also updated the javadoc and the associated string. But I cannot update translations (only spanish one, which I did), so we can wait for translators to update them before merging, or if that is not possible, we can remove the string in the other languages to make the user receive the english version instead of a misleading string.

Keep that good work!"

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,2017-05-10 15:16:29,It will not start a new day record immediatelly after 00:00 midnight,[],0,"I will explain what I mean. Now presume it's 23:58, March 13th. I've taken 10000 steps at this time. I walked on. Two minutes later, at 00:00 March 14th, I've taken another 100 steps. One minute later, to 00:01 March 14th, I took another 50 steps. Now I expect when I open Pedometer, it will show that I took 10100 steps on March 13th and 50 steps today (March 14th). But what I really see is, it shows that I took 10150 step yesterday (March 13th) and 0 steps today (March 14th). But now that I've opened the app manually and it's already a new day, it will start counting steps from 0 and work normally as expected. The problem is, the steps I took in the couple of minutes immediatelly after 00:00 everyday will be mistakenly accumulated to yesterday, rather than today. I tried add this app to the white list of android battery optimization, but that didn't help. I also checked the background process of Pedometer, it seems that the SensorListener service is running normally in the background, and this app is in the white list of my task killer. So where does the problem lie? Will Pedometer get a notification saying that it's 00:00 o'clock now so it can start a new day record? Or Pedometer just maintain a timer by itself and periodically save the current number of steps? Why Pedometer doesn't start a new day record immediatelly after 00:00 until I open the app manually?
I use CM13.0, Android 6.0.1."

It worked as I recorded a GPS track with Osmand or while counting steps with the other app called ""Pedometer"" from F-Droid (I'm using F-Droid as the repo for effectively every app on my phone) which also keeps the phone slightly busy.

Could it be that the step detector and counter does not function in deep sleep mode on some devices? Or could it have something to to with the circumstance that I have no GApps installed and removed some other proprietary elements with ""freecyngn"" (https://github.com/mar-v-in/freecyngn)?

Thoughts?

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,2017-04-23 08:38:22,Steps don't make it into history,[],0,"My step counts have been accurately (I assume) tracked since I installed the app a little over a week ago.  But the next day, those step counts are sometimes not visible in the graph.

I installed Pedometer 1.3.3 on a Nexus 5 running Android 4.4.4.

For about a week it worked great, reporting my approximately 3-10km of walking per day as 3600-11200 or so steps, which seems about right.  My walking habits have not changed, and the counter has continued to behave correctly (AFAICT).  But the history graph has not: the graph shows (from Tuesday): 6869, 7304, 7418, 2998 (plausible; I may have taken an easy day here but I don't remember), 179 (nope), 0 (this is Sunday, which does not actually make an appearance in the bar graph, although I walked at least 7 km), and 6743 (probably correct).

Curiouser and curiouser: this morning, the values from Friday onward were all less than 200 or so (I seem to remember, but can't swear, that Sunday made an appearance at something like 1 step), and I'm not sure why the graph decided to start showing one more correct value.  I did not clear Pedometer's cache or reboot (last reboot was Monday around noon-ish), but I did export the data to a csv file, which may have been responsible for the change in display???

This looks like a duplicate of bug 40, except that those seem to have been closed.  Resurfacing of old bug or a whole new one?

I haven't looked at the code, but here are some noteworthy events around the time the bug appeared:

(1) It's been installed for a little over a week, and it seems it throws out data after that long (the bar graph is only good for a week (which is disappointing, but that's another bug)).  Is it throwing out the wrong data?

(2) My phone crashed on Saturday (I think), and I know that on a crash-and-reboot the pedometer probably won't save the steps.  But it's been failing ever since.  I rebooted in the normal way on Saturday after the crash, just in case anything was still awry.

(3) Daylight Savings time switchover happened early Sunday morning.  Confusing to the app?

(4) Sometime around Friday I calibrated my step size using the GPS (by concurrently running Runtastic) a couple of times, and changed my step size first to 92, and then to 90, cm.  Possible trigger?

Thanks!

If i open the app and start shaking the mobile up and down, it still won't count any step.

I tried:
- Closing the app
- trying to disable/enable the notification from the settings
