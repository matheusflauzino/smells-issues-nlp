The app looks promising and quite what I am looking for.
However, I live in a shared flat, and in order to coordinate our shopping we require a list that can be accessed by several users / our group (as in out-of-milk).
Unfortunately, such a feature is a must for our shopping list (too many cases of three breads or 6 liters of milk), and I would be delighted if a future version would include this feature.

It certainly needs some optimization (e.g., one could choose to require unlocking when trying to choose another shopping list, or perhaps make this feature opt-in via the app's settings, etc.).

I've been doing some research on accessibility features for mobile applications and selected some applications to evaluate. There are some improvements I'd suggest for your applications so users with visual disabilities would be able to use it, specially if they are using screen readers such as talk back:

Main activity
- The button (+) to create a list has no label, i.e., a speakable text for the screen reader

New List
- Consider making clickable items larger. For example, the input field to write the shopping list name, Notes, Priority spinner, Deadling checkbox and statistics on/off button. Moreover, the contrast ratio of the on/off button should be increased.

New Product
- Consider making clickable items larger. The icon to open more fields (category, store) has no label. A blind user using a screen reader would not know what is it for. 

Showing the products of the list
- icon to show the details of the product has no label.

Those are some examples of improvements you could make to became your app more accessible. I refer to [android accessibility best practices](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps.html). If you need some help, please let me know I have an academic testing tool that might be useful to test your app and report all accessibility issues you might want to take a look. "

Instead of bringing up a list containing all items to select the the ones that should appear in the new list, this feature allows the user creating a list that contains ALL items in the app. If a product is in multiple lists, then it quantity and price is filled with the average values. After creating a list using this feature the user will immediately be able to select all irrelevant items and remove them from the new list.

Basically there are only two steps:
1. Create a list by clicking on the icon with the three horizontal bars and a plus sign.
2. Delete the irrelevant items. If you want to have all items in your list, just click on the ""return"" arrow icon and you'll be in the new list.

The search feature was also improved. Now the search considers all products in the app. If a product doesn't belong to the current list, then this item will have plus icon. By clicking in this icon you would be copying that product into the current list.

This ""cleanup"" was not added. I personally think that this feature could be confusing for some users. Checked items are always at the bottom and if the list should be reused, then the reset feature could be used to set all check boxes to false. If the user only wants to reused part of the list, then the relevant products can be searched by using the search box or by simply scrolling and remove the check manually. Notice that if you check a product twice, then the statistics (if enabled) will register this product twice. That's was the original idea to allow using the same list multiple times and still be able to have a record.

Buttons in the action bar are now only visible if there are lists or products. This was modified because these buttons (i.e. sort and delete) are not need if there are no lists. The same happens for products."

3. When ready or even while shopping cleanup list (all marked Items disappear but keep them in the database!)

Recurring shopping:
1. Bring up a list of all already created items and mark what should reappear in the shopping list. 
2. Activating search should also query and display items from the database (not visible in current shopping list)

I think from the database perspective it should be enough to add a field e.g. ""visible"" and to only show visible Items in the list.

Additionally a button to set all checked and visible Items to invisible (i.e. cleanup)."

Big Fix: There was an undesired white border in the dialogs for all devices using an android API < 21. This border was removed."

SecUSo/privacy-friendly-shopping-list,closed,2016-11-19 22:05:17,"closes #7. Duplicate lists, Screen rotation, ScrollViews, Async Refactoring",[],0,"Hi, this branch contains the implementation of a feature that allows users duplicating lists. The dialog shown after a list ""onLongClick"" event had to be changed (See image at the end). The dialog for products remained the same. It might a good idea to change that dialog as well, so both dialogs look similar. I could do that if you agree with the changes.

Additionally manifest file was updated in order to support screen rotation. This feature was only tested in Android 6.0. To be honest I'm not sure if something else would have to be implemented in the Activities for older versions. If that's the case, these changes could easily be reverted.

Scroll views where added to the dialogs for creating and editing products or lists. The reason was that some users have to hide their keyboard in order to be able to see the fields at the bottom (i.e the last field ""Store"" in the product's dialog). 

The last change had to do with performance. According to the book _Learning Reactive Programming with Java 8_ creating new threads each time is expensive. They recommend using the computation scheduler. Therefore the Scheduler was changed from newThread() to computation().

I took the liberty of updating the app version to 1.0.4.
