EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Updated eu (Basque) translation,[],0,Commit made via [Stringlate](https://lonamiwebs.github.io/stringlate/)
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Request: clear entire history,[],0,It would be nice to be able to clear the full history with a single button or from settings. After doing a lot of conversions deleting them one-by-one is too time consuming.
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,"Missing currencies, update API",[],0,"It seems that quite some currencies disappeared after the update to 1.7. Looking at 1d77ddc8, the reason is the switch to ECB's data which in turn was necessary because Yahoo discontinued its API.

There is a thread concerning this problem and one of the answers suggest using https://openexchangerates.org and others. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/38357848

How about implementing multiple providers with some sort of prioritizing (when a currency is referred in multiple sources).

Letting the user define a custom currency #7 is another approach and useful as well."

EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Affix of Angle Conversions and Viscosity Conversions on Equate,[],0,"### Proposals

I use Equate on my smartphone. After 3 weeks using this application, I found flaws in the application. So I want to share my opinion and here are my proposals.

* Angle conversions
* Viscosity conversions

Angle conversions: there are several angle units that can be used, namely rad, deg (°), min ('), sec (""), grad and circle.

Viscosity conversions: there are several viscosity units that can be used, namely poise, centipoise, kg/m.s and lb/ft.hr.

### Benefits

Angle units and viscosity units are units that are often used, especially for students in the field of engineering like me. Angle conversions can help users to convert an angle unit into other angle units as needed. Viscosity conversions can help the user to convert a viscosity unit into other viscosity units as needed. Angle conversions and viscosity conversions can facilitate users (especially students) to convert angle units and viscosity units when completing tasks in terms of measurement, practicum and practice questions."
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Cryptocurrency rates not working,[],0,"For a few days now, the cryptocurrency rates haven't been working. Any ideas why?

Actually, looking at it, I think all the rates are down.

Thanks"
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Add option for hPa and fuel weight conversions,[],0,"Hi,
I miss hPa unit there is only Pa and kPa and mostly pressure is given in hPa it would be more convenient to have hPa.
Also it would be nice to have fuel conversions from liters to kg and such for some types of fuel like 100LL, Jet-A.

Great app!
Thanks."

EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Request: Add decred (DCR) to cryptocurrencies,[],0,"Can you please add decred (symbol: DCR) to the cryptocurrencies. This blockchain has been around a long time (years) and is currently #41 on CMC.

Thanks"
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Memory Leak,[],0,"After a double background-foreground event of the CalcActivity there are in heap memory more instances of:

class com.llamacorp.equate.view.ConvertButton @ 0x12e4f000
class com.llamacorp.equate.view.ConvKeysFragment$2 @ 0x12dfed00
class com.llamacorp.equate.view.ConvKeysFragment @ 0x12c8d400
class com.llamacorp.equate.view.ConvKeysFragment$1 @ 0x12dfec40
class com.llamacorp.equate.view.ConvKeysFragment$3 @ 0x12dfedc0

It should not be like this because the background-foreground events return to the same GUI state and the memory should stay in the same state as well. It could be a symptom of a bad management of the onStart-onStop lifecycle. 

I have encountered this problem on an Android emulator running 7.1.1 os version.

EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Request: epoch time,[],0,I am not sure how to fit this in to `Equate` but I would love to see epoch/unix time added. Even if it is something as simple as epoch time to a human readable format.
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Disable number separator,[],0,"Is it possible to disable number separators? I prefer to see `1234567` rather than `1,234,567`."
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Add trigonometric functions,[],0,"Would need a nice way to add them which does not clutter the main interface. Perhaps a slide in menu like the existing main menu, but from the right instead?"
EvanRespaut/Equate,open,,Limit number of decimals,[],0,"Thanks for an excellent app! Feature request: configurable max number of decimals displayed. It's just that I rarely need many decimals in the result and would prefer that more expressions in the history view could fit on one line instead of breaking to two lines. So not only limiting the number of decimals in the results but also ensuring that the left side can expand to make use of the horizontal space freed up.

Not so important request... just a small improvement."

I know bitcoin is already present but dash is my primary digital currency. It would be very easy to add, here is the free API to Kraken that gives the price in USD:

If someone can make this happen, I would be happy to tip them. Thank you.
