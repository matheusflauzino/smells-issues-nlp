kwantam/batsHIIT,open,,"Provide a ""pause"" button",[],0,"Hi,

sometimes when in busy hours one might not be able to follow the **break** interval exactly to the second because a machine may be busy, and if the app is not paused the next interval could start when the exercise has not started yet. Not ideal but it happened to me.

I know that having the app to loose focus (for example by pushing the power button on the phone) would pause it, but it would be more usable if the pause functionality was built-in.

Maybe a `pause/go` button, possibly with a `next/skip` button to manually go to the next interval.

Thanks,
   Antonio"
kwantam/batsHIIT,open,,Signal the END of an interval in a more incisive way,[],0,"Hi,

first of all, is the app name a word-play on https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=batshit ?
Maybe it refers to crazy workouts? I wasn't sure because I am not a native English speaker.

Now to the feature request:

the 4 chirps which signal the end of an interval are OK, but it would be even better if some more **incisive** tone would be played when the interval actually ends.

This would be especially useful in a crowded room when the screen is not in sight, sometime I just can't hear the chirps.

Maybe this could be an optional alternative to the chirps, if having both the chirps and the ending sound is too much.

Ciao,
   Antonio"
kwantam/batsHIIT,open,,[feature request] Decrease work per block,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"It would be nice if there would be a way to decrease the work-time by a constant after each block.
e.g. work=30, work_decrease=5, break=10, rest=60, 5 intervals per block would result in:

1. Warmup (60s)
 - **30s** work / 10s break
 - **25s** work / 10s break
 - **20s** work / 10s break
 - **15s** work / 10s break
 - **10s** work / 10s break
2. Cooldown (60s)

That would help with ongoing exhaustion and can increase the motivation to do more blocks.
A value of 0 as default would replicate the current behaviour.
