Just like some similar apps, regardless of the orientation, users should be able to use the App without any errors 

***Actual Behavior***

When in a folder of where pictures are stored, and the device orientation goes landscape, it would take users to the root folder and start all over again..... 



***How to produce the bug***

* Open the app 
* Locate and select any folder where images are stored 
* Rotate screen
* It would take you to the root folder where you have to start all over again 

 

***TEST TOOLS***

* Operating system : Android 6.0
* Phone : Infinix hot s
