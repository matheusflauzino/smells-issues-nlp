Also a swipe up/down in single image fullscreen mode to exit it and return to folder/album would be great, just like you can already do with swiping out of folders, making navigation between images and folders a breeze.

kollerlukas/Camera-Roll-Android-App,open,,Navigate between picture previews without swiping effect = slideshow = a computer gallery behaviour,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]",0,"I previously opened an issue for this (#155) but we seemed to have had a little misunderstanding.
The idea I tried to present is to have the possibility to toggle a mode with which you don't have to swipe to pass from one picture to the next or previous picture.
Maybe some people could like it to function as a slideshow or diaporama, images could just go one after another at regular interval. But for me the really important point is that the images do not move left or right or switch from one to the next with any effect (just like in the third example I give in #155).
In this mode, you can play pause image passing. But most importantly (to me ;)) you can pass to the next/previous image with a simple tap on the left or right part of the screen.

This is how I see the UI:
   - when viewing an image, tap in the three dot top right menu, you find ""slideshow"",
   - you click on slideshow => the title and other menus disappear,
   - you can tap the right or left part of the screen to go to next or previous image,
   - to exit this mode, you click the back button which brings you back to the normal image view.

_+ this mode could implement lots of gesture shortcuts to trash images (swiping up), like an image (swiping down)... ideally, those gesture shortcuts could even be chosen by the user._

For autoplaying of slideshow, I see two options (that can be combined):
   - it's just an option in the app settings, ""autoplay in slideshow mode""
   - **or/and** in slideshow mode, if you tap in the middle part of the screen it displays controls (play/pause, next, previous) and you can use those controls to navigate or to trigger playing or pausing of the slideshow. If you wait a few seconds or tap in another part of the screen, the controls disappear.

To me, this feature is THE feature ;) It would be awesomely valuable to select and rate images.

Hope that's a clear and not over detailed explanation.
Thanks for the great app, again and again :)"

I'm not 100% sure I understand what that means because I've tried different view styles, and it seem that the number of columns stays the same when I change, it doesn't seem to save one for each.

However a real plus would be to be able to set a custom number of columns per folder.
I don't know if that's easy to do. If it's not, a workaround could be to at least make it easier to change the number of columns from folder views. So one doesn't have to get back to main view, open settings, change columns count, and get back to the folder they're were watching."

Thanks a lot for your work on this app. 
It is really perfect. Simple yet refined. 

This is how the virtual folder feature works on my device : 
When the app starts it displays a list of all the albums/folders but not the virtual ones. 
Then I hit refresh and the list only displays the virtual albums and the folders that are not part of a virtual one. 
Every time I go back to the list, it switches to the first view (all folders). And I have to refresh to see the virtual folders. 

Is it a bug ? The intended behaviour ?

kollerlukas/Camera-Roll-Android-App,open,,Some usability suggestions .. if possible :),"[Label(name=""improvement"")]",0,"1. Multiple selections - replace Delete button (green one, lower right) with ""Share"" button.
Reason: Usually I delete photo one by one, after I review it - realizing I have a better one, I delete the one I currently see. I believe other people do this too...
The only moment I want to do bulk operations (select 10 photos for example) is when I want to share them with friends. However, the big green button in the lower right is the ""Delete"" button. Would it please be possible to make it a Share button ?

2. On the main screen, if an album photo is too bright, the album name is barely visible. I notice a gray gradient, but the gray gradient is too white to the top, and too gray at the bottom (so the second line, the number of photos in the album, is also not visible). But only on albums with white album image.

3. If I enter a small album and quickly scroll at the bottom, the application goes 'Back' to the main list without showing any of the images within. I have to wait until few images appear. I believe the functionality is that if you reach the end and then you still decide to scroll up, the whole album goes 'up' too, revealing the main list. However, on small albums, click and then immediately scroll up -> it goes back instead of scrolling down first. Probably the list still believe it is empty when the images haven't appeared yet.

4. Rotate would be Very Useful.

5. Use-case: Select few images and share them with few friends. Select the images -> choose to Share them -> select which app -> Send in the social app -> Back few times -> back to CR. However, CR just lost the selections! I have to select again the photos I wanted to send to next friend. Would it be possible for CR to keep the selection once you are back on the Activity ?

An excellent application is one where you see opportunities to improve :)
Thank you,

kollerlukas/Camera-Roll-Android-App,open,,Integrate GCam Folders into Camera album,"[Label(name=""feature request"")]",0,"Hey there, for those of use who use Google Camera, when features like Burst Shot or Portrait Mode are used, GCam creates a subfolder within the /DCIM/Camera folder which contains each burst shot grouping (or, in portrait mode, the pair of portrait/non-portrait shots). These subfolders have the naming scheme ""IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHmm"". As seen below, these folders can quickly accumulate if you use these features regularly:

![screenshot_20180131-222426](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4620093/35620770-3655178c-06d6-11e8-99fe-8b3c2910a088.png)

The issue is, Camera Roll has a tendency to detect each folder as a separate album, rapidly clogging up a user's gallery with albums, especially if that user is using the parallax style. This is even more of a problem if the Camera album is pinned, as every one of these subfolders then automatically becomes pinned, meaning they never migrate to the bottom of the list. This can be seen here:

![screenshot_20180131-222216](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4620093/35620891-9f0514e4-06d6-11e8-95b7-f17f78d7283d.png)

The Google Photos app handles this by treating each of those subfolders as a single image, and when you view that image, you can navigate between burst-shots or turn on/off portrait mode. I was hoping Camera Roll might be able to implement a similar feature, however that is a lot of work to support a single app, so I was hoping you might at least consider making Camera Roll recognise all subfolders of /DCIM/Camera matching that naming convention simply display their contents as part of the Camera album rather than as separate albums themselves.

On a slightly related note, this also brings to light the issue that subfolders act as pins if their parent folder is pinned, and in the case of DCIM, if you pin Camera, every folder in DCIM acts pinned, even though they're subfolders of DCIM rather than /DCIM/Camera. An option to not pin subfolders if a parent folder is pinned would be super appreciated!

Thanks for all the time/effort you put into making this amazing app :)"

First off, great work! Thanks for your time, this app really has good potential.

I have checked the previous issues. I think I found a bug: I have a folder say ""oldies"" which has 16 photos , in the sd card. Camera roll shows two different albums for it with the same name, showing 10 and 6 photos respectively, exclusive of each other. I think the expected behaviour is to show one album per folder. I have not created any virtual albums. The same happens for two more folders, which are apparently split among two albums. I already tried refreshing, clearing data, restarting, etc.

But, is it possible to disable (or have it optionally at least) the sorting of the photos when i share several photos to external application?

It seems it was introduced by this change: [link](https://github.com/kollerlukas/Camera-Roll-Android-App/commit/b3240b69c9b064eea18a1d6b22e5051941044204#diff-fa7f96d96830e3094d63066f2fbda3eeR85), but i think without ""sortStringArray"" it will be much better. So photos will be shared to external app in same order, in which i have made a selection of each photo.

For example when i share the photos to Google+ i prefer to have them in some specific order. Sometimes it is a custom order which i want, sometimes it is in chronological order, i.e. from photo with older date/time to photo with most recent date/time.
But Camera Roll always sort the photos in order from recent time to older time, when sharing to external app (of course depending on album sorting settings), and in most cases the external app does not have options to re-arrange photos.

Most gallery apps like QuickPic, respects my selection order, so, why Camera Roll app does not support this?

Bugs:

1. When the ""MediaRetriever"" setting is on, some pictures cause the app to crash when opened (looks like the pictures that cause the error are the ones which don't appear when the option is turned off).

Suggestions (most of them are minor things):

1. On the image info box, I think it's better if unknown exif data aren't shown at all (for example when the exposure is unknown, no need to show ""exposure: unknown"").
2. After changing some settings (like MediaRetriever) it would be nice if the main view is automatically refreshed instead of refreshing manually.
3. Swipe down to refresh would also be a nice addition.
4. Add option to sort descending or ascending.
5. When you scroll to the very bottom of the main view and do a quick swipe upwards, the view won't scroll all the way to the top (kinda hard to explain but I hope you got it).
6. White theme with the light green accent theme doesn't seem to go really well ;)
7. On the white theme, it would be nicer if the action bar (on the main view) and folder name has black color instead of grey.
8. There should be a maximum value for the column count option.
9. The preview image on the style settings are a little bit blurry (yes I know this is really minor but it kinda bothers me a bit hehe).
10. A ""letter bubble"" on the scrollbar on the main view would be nice too.

The video playback is really buggy. When I tap a video from a folder or swipe to it from a picture, the app takes a lot longer to open than a picture. The video controls are also really bare (there is only play and pause). Rotating the orientation of the device is not seamless, the video goes black for a second, then shifts and is paused. After the video is finished playing, if I hit play again, nothing happens; I expect to replay the video on click.
