OpenArchive/openarchive,open,,Error uploading image not detected,[],0,"Here's the feedback that you asked for in the OTF-active mailing list.

## Description

I was testing the application (my first use of the application and archive.org). I was trying to upload an image, but I'm in a train, so the internet connection is not really stable and the upload failed. The app did not detect that and kept showing ""Uploading image""

Edit: I'm using the 0.0.18-alpha-1 version: https://github.com/OpenArchive/openarchive-android/releases/download/0.0.18-alpha-1/OpenArchive-0.0.18-alpha-1-releaseflavor-release.apk

## Steps to reproduce

1. Make a photo
1. Upload the image with the OA Android app
2. Disconnect your internet

## Expected behaviour

The app shows a message saying ""upload failed"" and preferably also a retry-button.

## Actual behaviour

App keeps saying ""Uploading image"". To retry you have to click back, click your image again and click upload again.

## Screenshot

## Issue
Eventbus isn't registered properly, perhaps should be registered during an activity lifecycle event.  

## Reproduce by
1. Click floating action button (represented by a ""plus"" sign).
2. Click ""Nearby Receive"" button
3. Click ""cancel"" on bottom right of screen, or ""paired devices only"". 

This will try to unregister EventBus which may have not been registered if bluetooth isn't turned on. 
If EventBus is registered even on the constructor of _BluetoothReceiver_ this will still fail.

## Fix 
Register Eventbus in an Activity.
Or substitute Libnearby library with a similar library.

OpenArchive/openarchive,open,,some 1-star ratings in Google Play are actually positive,"[Label(name=""bug""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]",1,"They are in Arabic and Persian, could it be a Right to Left discrepancy? Would love thoughts, not too concerned about it, but could see it scaling to be a larger problem when we get more reviews.

Some mysteries: 
- A few 1-star ratings were negative and the 5-star ones I translated were positive, so I'm really unsure what's going on since it would follow that 5 stars would = dissatisfied if my theory were correct.

- Examples of ratings that didn't correspond to the stars (according to g-translate):

A.M. gave 1 star and wrote: Very good and very good
anon. user gave 3 stars and wrote: Excellent
Q.N.  gave 3 stars and wrote: Great"

We are trying to balance the experience between the users who will likely just fill out nothing and leave all the defaults, and the ones who would want access to all the possible fields that IA offers.

Right now, you can login to IA later and edit to your hearts content. In the future, I think the ability to expand or customize the list of fields on the client app, and edit the upload later would be great to add.
