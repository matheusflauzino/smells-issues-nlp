What worse asking this question on submitting notes makes interface more complicated and cluttered."

Many bugs never go away.  I fix an error.  The map tile doesn't change (see https://github.com/ChristopherGittner/OSMBugs/issues/12) but in most (all?) cases the bug doesn't go away either.  New bugs I introduce (oops!) appear, but ones I fix hang around.

In some cases maybe my fix was wrong in some way, but I fixed a feature (a footpath passing through a car park that actually terminated at the boundary of the car park and followed a different route anyway) and the bug is still there.  I deleted the existing footpath (which was wrong in so many ways) and added a new footpath.  That's an Osmose bug.  There are other Osmose bugs that are hanging around.

I replaced a URL that Keepright picked up as not containing the name of the location in the web page (it didn't, because the URL was to a site that no longer has content).  Keepright still shows the same bug, relating to the same empty web site.  Etc.

Mapdust has no bugs shown at all.

I'm not sure if OSM notes is keeping up or not.  I didn't really pay attention to it.

They're all enabled in settings.  I've tried settings->keepright->reset visible bugs.  Doesn't seem to do anything.   Similarly android's settings->apps->osmbugs->flush cached data.

The ones I've mentioned are at least a week old.  Do these bug monitors really update so infrequently?  If so, some help information in the app mentioning this would be useful."
Gittner/OSMBugs,closed,2017-09-28 17:58:16,Map tile cacheing,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",1,"A bug (separate from https://github.com/ChristopherGittner/OSMBugs/issues/11) to do with tile cacheing.

This had been driving me mad.  Some changes I made on OSM appeared fairly quickly, others never did even though I'd made the change weeks ago.

Some changes I made a while ago appear at low zooms and high zooms but **not** at one of the intermediate zoom levels.  Another change I made even longer ago doesn't appear at **any** zoom level.  Other changes appear at all zoom levels.

I think I've finally figured out what is going on.  It appears you're never flushing/expiring tiles in your tile cache.  So what I see depends if I've ever looked at a particular area in OSMBugs before I made the change.  If I haven't, then if I make a change and look in OSMBugs the change appears at all zoom levels.  But if I've looked at it before in OSMBugs at some zoom levels, those tiles are frozen to before the change.

I did go to android settings->apps->osmbugs and cleared the cached data, but it didn't help.  I could try clearing all the data, but that means losing settings.  In any case, maybe you're pulling those tiles from a server other than OSM's and it has a never-expiring cache.

Something, somewhere, is giving me stale tiles.  Fresh tiles if I've not looked somewhere at a particular zoom level before, but stale otherwise.  If it's a problem with a server cacheing the tiles then I'd get stale if nobody had ever needed that tile before (which is probably the case, since I'm in an area with a low population density and seem to be the only active mapper for 10 miles around).

Whatever the cause is, it makes OSMBugs rather useless.

Go back to map, either by clicking on the bug symbol at top-left (it's not intuitive that takes you back to the map) or the navbar back arror.  Either way the bugs are there but the map tiles are not.  Zoom out a couple of levels and map tiles return.

Also happens one level below max, maybe two levels below.

german: es wäre wünschenswert, wenn die Karte weiter aufgezoomt werden könnte um Notes präziser platzieren zu können. Immerhin ist es eine Touchpad-App.

Gittner/OSMBugs,open,,posibility of persistant data for offline use?,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"It would be good if downloaded bugs data was persistent (in the same way that background map seems to be).

Many of the times I'm in the area with bad or nonexistant cell signal, so I need offline functionality - that is, download bugs and background map of the area beforehand when I have data connectivity, and then go out to map non covered area.

OSMBugs does seem to work for a while, but after some nondeterministic time (few to dozens of minuts, usually after switching apps etc) all the bugs dissapear from display (while the background map stays visible ok).

it would be great if keepright/osmose/Notes could persist the same way the background map seems to.

the creation of bugs have been disabled on the OSB homepage. The API is still open, but it would be cool If you could disable the creation of new bugs on OSB.

I think the following configuration would be fine:
- disable creation of new OSB tickets (code)
- disable usage of OSB by default (configuration)
- make sure that you're APP is still working if the OSB server disapears some day.
