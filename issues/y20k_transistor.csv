Oftentimes streams on the lists have the same content at different bitrate. Sometimes URLs on the lists change in time and/or ""space"". For example to connect users to the closest transmitting server. This is how things might work

1. A user inputs playlist URL when adding a station.
1. Transistor downloads the playlist, saves a list of stream URL-s **and** the playlist URL as a single station.
1. The user chooses a stream to play.
1. The stream is marked as default.
1. Next time user tunes in the station, the default stream is played.
1. The user can choose to play a different stream from the list.
1. The user can reload the playlist to get an up to date list of streams. If the default stream is not present on the new list, the user is required to choose a stream again.

Having the same station at different bitrates for different situations (e.g. mobile connectivity vs wifi) as a single item on the list of stations seems more convenient than having two separate stations."

For example, I'm switching to a `TreeMap` instead of a `LinkedHashMap` so I can actually iterate from one element to the next; but that changes the sort order so it's no longer the order they were created in.

To test: install [android-media-controller](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-media-controller) and use that to control transistor.  While there _is_ a [desktop head unit](https://developer.android.com/training/auto/testing/) for Android Auto, I couldn't figure out how to make that emulate previous/next buttons.

y20k/transistor,closed,2018-08-08 07:50:35,"Writing to external storage seems to fail, app handles this poorly","[Label(name=""bug"")]",1,"Underlying issue:
- The app has storage permissions enabled.
- /sdcard1/Android/org.y20k.transistor/files/Collection/ is created. 
- Adding a new station works, either by opening the stream file from a file browser, by opening it from the browser, or by manually inputting the url. That is, a stream is added to the list and can be played. However, no file is created under the /files/Collection/ directory.

I believe this is due to a bug in my device: https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/bug_tracker/issues/125 and that's obviously not Transistor's fault. However I'm opening this bug report due to Transistor's handling of this error:

1. Adding a new stream works. As mentioned, no file is created on the sdcard. The user is not informed that a file was not created.
2. Attempting to change a stream's icon launches the gallery. However, after an image is chosen it is not updated and user is not informed that an error occurred. 
3. Exiting the app via back button, or changing to a different app via multitasking, will result in it launching next time with an empty stream list. User is not warned before app is closed.
4. Refreshing the stream lists via pull-to-refresh will cause the entire stream list to be deleted. User is not informed why streams were deleted. I would argue that even if the refresh finds that some stream files have been removed from the SD card, the user should be warned that they'll be removed from the list.


As an aside, the app's minimal interface makes these issues especially frustrating, as there is no way to understand what's going on and why data keeps getting deleted. I thought the app hasn't even implemented saving the state of the stream library until I read the github page.

(you can skip this part)

Some brainstorming on the subject.

Let's say I am listening to radio,  with Transistor on the background, and then choose to  play a video on the Youtube. Transistor will stop, the video will be playing, and the first thing I will have to do is adjust the volume on my phone.

Then, if I want to stop the video and wish to go back to listening to the radio, with Transistor, again, I will have to adjust the volume on my phone.

Possibly, the same might need to be done when switching between radio stations.

We could say that the ""volume problem"" is a common issue on the web media.

Therefore, Transistor should have a volume adjustment (for itself, not for the system).

How would that adjustment look like?
From a practical point of view, it should be  a slider.
But, since this is Transistor, a retro reference might be preferred:
a big volume knob.

----


How big would that knob be?
Simply, while holding your phone with your hands, try to draw a curve or a circle, on the screen, using your thumb, as if you were turning the imaginary knob.

There you have the outline of the ""big volume knob""."

## Test using your phone
If you want to test Auto support on your phone you need to enable **Developer Mode** and **Unknown Sources**

* see: [Testing apps for phone screen](https://developer.android.com/training/auto/testing/index.html#phone) 

## Test using your car
Sorry. I am not sure how to test this in an actual car. You probably need to activate **Unknown Sources** somehow. Because by default Android Auto only runs / displays Apps from the Play Store.

This radio player can definitely play all the existing streaming formats so it should tout itself as such.

Transistor only adds a single station from a playlist with bunch of stations. It would be nice if one could actually import bunch of stations from a playlist, otherwise it is a bit tedious of work to bring those all in.

One might argue well this is a minimalist app and such, it defeats the purpose of  being a simple radio app, but then as a user I would counter argue that it makes it useless for my purposes because then I will need to use another app to manage all those stations and occasionally give this app another try to see  what is going on with it.

	-adding more metadata to stations (currently no way to change all metadata throw UI, we can only import xml with all metadata of channel, we may add editing later in next versions).
	-new station rating modules (currently it's local rating only, not sync to central rating, may be later in next versions)
	-Using Facebook fresco image viewer (SimpleDraweeView) with it's great loading features
	-Apply Material design components and transitions

Transistor traditionally has used [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html) as its back-end. MedaPlayer for the most part has worked great for me. But there are some issues with AAC and newer adaptive streaming technologies, as well as sometimes a slow start-up time.

In the past I was very hesitant regarding any experiments with the back-end, since the existing one worked most of the time just fine. I argued that Transistor is basically a one-man-part-time-show, and that I needed to keep development sustainable. Therefore I did (and do) not want to experiment with any third-party media libraries.

Enter [ExoPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer.html). ExoPlayer is an open source media library developed by Google. It is used as the back-end of their YouTube app. ExoPlayer promises better codec compatibility. It is probably pretty future proof, since Google uses it in their own apps. 

So after some thinking/considering I decided to give it a try. The results are pretty good so far. It seems that streams start faster than in the past and Transistor still plays back all of my (23) stations.

Switching the back-end is a pretty big thing. So before I roll out the next version of Transistor, **I need YOU to test the playback functionality** of the app. I need to decide if I should continue to pursue the ExoPlayer route, of if I should go back to MediaPlayer.

So if anyone here has time to spare: Please check out the latest beta release.

During my commute I pass two, or three, spots where I have nearly no reception for a few seconds.

Transistor pauses playback for a few seconds when the reception/connection is lost, resumes when the connection returns and stops playing after another few seconds.
Then it starts buffering again and starts playback as normal.

I have the feeling that MediaPlayer pauses and resumes the remaining buffered data when it detects a network failure and then starts to buffer again when the (too small) buffer has been depleted. (Wild guess :-))

I have not looked at this in detail, but ExoPlayer could provide access to more fine grained tuning of networking/buffering stuff - https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/

The audio playback will stop after a period of about 10 minutes up to an hour, I think. After a period of several minutes (something like 5-30 minutes) playback will often resume. Sometimes this doesn't happen though (or maybe I didn't wait long enough). If it resumes it will keep playing for a period of a few seconds up to 15 minutes, maybe. After this point, I might as well stop Transistor, because playback has become so unstable.

Playback is extremely stable and never stops, when the phone is connected to power. Also the playback is stable and never stops, when I'm actually using the phone (screen on). So the problem only occurs when the phone is lying flat on its back and running on battery. These are the reasons why I think it's related to doze.

I've tried disabling Androids built-in battery optimization for Transistor, but this makes no difference. I read somewhere that you're using Androids audio playback for the stream, so maybe that's why disabling battery optimization for Transistor has no effect.

y20k/transistor,closed,2016-03-18 08:25:02,Reconnect to the stream...,[],0,"Hi!

Transistor is a great little app. I like it a lot!

I have a small issue though, which I think would be easy to remedy. 

I tend to listen to Transistor while travelling, and the stream often disconnects at some point in my journey. It would be nice if Transistor automatically tried to reconnect when this happens.

The most annoying instance of this occurs every time I leave my house with Transistor playing. When I get about 50 feet from my house, the wifi signal drops out, and the phone switches to 3G mode. Since the IP address has changed, the stream disconnects. Since it's freezing cold outside, it's pretty irritating to have to take off my gloves, take out my phone, and, with frozen fingers, unlock it, open the app, and press the big play button.

Every... single... time....

:)

I'd love if it either could detect when the network went up/down, or if it just kept trying to reconnect every 5 seconds or something. (Ideally both!)

I just send the `Content-type` header returned by an HTTP server into the RegEx and assign the capture groups to a container object.

The actual detection of playlist/audio-file was not changed.

The charset is currently not used but maybe be taken in account in the future.

There also was a bug in the `contentType.substring()` method call, which led to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in some cases. That should be fixed, too.

I hope the pattern is hard enough to persist exotic headers :)

1. Notification has 'content hidden' while in the lockscreen. This is fixed with VISIBILITY_PUBLIC flag.

What you need is 'Tap to stop', or even better full controls with prev/next/close buttons. And you need to create this notification by creating a Service and calling startForeground() on it. I've got a similar patch for KDE Connect lying around, I'll adapt it for Transistor (and those lazy bums won't merge my patch after 4 months, and also KDEConnect on PC messes up all windows at random, so I'm back to using MPD, why all reliable music stuff on Debian must come in a console-only form?).

   Explanation for issues of type ""ExtraTranslation"":
   If a string appears in a specific language translation file, but there is
   no corresponding string in the default locale, then this string is probably
   unused. (It's technically possible that your application is only intended
   to run in a specific locale, but it's still a good idea to provide a
   fallback.).

   Note that these strings can lead to crashes if the string is looked up on
   any locale not providing a translation, so it's important to clean them
   up.

1 errors, 0 warnings
```

while I can (and did) forcefully ignore them in gradle's `android` section with

```
lintOptions {

This is a hack. A release should build with out modification. Either fix those issues on your side or (just in case) apply the workaround in your build.gradle :)

Thanks for making this app.

I tried it and run into problems. Transistor seems to fail to play some streams. 
At least it failed playing this one:
http://www.dradio.de/streaming/dlf_hq_ogg.m3u

Hope you can fix it.
