greenaddress/GreenBits,open,,Display error message when hardware wallet fails to sign a transaction,[],0,"Some hardware wallets like the Ledger Unplugged and the Fidesmo Yubikey use NFC to sign transactions. When the user taps Review & Send, the transaction data is sent over NFC to the hardware wallet for signing. Due to the nature and short range of the NFC link, this process is prone to failure.  

As of GreenBits 2.02, there seems to be no feedback to inform the user when the signing goes wrong. It does not tell the user when to tap the wallet on the NFC reader, either. All the user can do is wait on the Send tab, and log out/close/restart the app to try again if it seems to be stuck.  

GreenBits should at least display an error message in that case, and ideally allow the user to retry the operation, prompting to tap the wallet and asking for the PIN again if needed."

greenaddress/GreenBits,closed,2017-04-26 15:40:03,[UI] monetary formatting,[],0,"Hi there. I'm using GreenBits 1.91 from F-Droid and would like to suggest some improvements in the user interface.

I can not get the local builds running, so I will try to simply point out the code fragement which are probably important for what I describe.
- Space between currency symbol and the amount is missing, e.g., [ListTransactionsAdapter.java:L57](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/greenaddress/greenbits/ui/ListTransactionsAdapter.java#L57) vs. [ListTransactionsAdapter.java:L59](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/greenaddress/greenbits/ui/ListTransactionsAdapter.java#L59): `""bits ""` comes with space, but somehow `R.string.fa_btc_space` not; is it possible to add a space behind the latter?
- If possible, please set fixed number of decimals, i.e., always 8 decimals for BTC or 2 decimals for _bits_. Is that possible? I had a look into [MonetaryFormat.java:354](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits/blob/master/bitcoinj/core/src/main/java/org/bitcoinj/utils/MonetaryFormat.java#L354) and it looks like a feature to trim trailing zeros. This makes the amounts _jumping_ around in the interface (as they are aligned right) and it's not obvious on first glance which are big and which are small amounts. A cool way would be not to trim them but to style them in a very light grey. What do you think?

It also sometimes looks very strage, if you have fiat currency values with only one decimal digit, e.g., `$ 210.4`.

Thanks

- The bitcoins balance showed NOT on the correct account.
- Then showed duplicated on two of my accounts
- When I selected the account with bitcoin, I didn't see transfers history.
  Obs. All showed correctly after I restart the app.

greenaddress/GreenBits,open,,[NTH] 2FA not effective on a stolen or lost phone. U2F on Yubiko NEO a better solution.,[],0,"# The weakness

While for a web app it makes perfect sense to have the 2FA on sms phone call or google authenticator because you have to show the possess of a second device, in the case of an android app you have everything you need to confirm the transaction on the same device the app is on.

This well known and hardly avoidable weakness could be healed by having the second factor on a device  other from the phone.
## One possible solution

Yubiko NEO [supports U2F over NFC](https://www.yubico.com/faq/does-my-yubikey-neo-support-u2f-over-nfc/). It would be possible to set up an other confirmation method based on this kind of devices.
## Use case

The user make ""sign and verify"" the transaction on Greenbits.
A message reports the detail of the transaction and ask to swipe the yubikey on the phone.
The U2F enabled yubiko NEO is swapped on the phone and the transaction is authorized.

greenaddress/GreenBits,closed,2015-02-28 13:47:13,Fix crash after sending funds by doing some code cleanup.,[],0,"When sending funds on my phone the GreenBits app always crashed after submitting the transaction. It was annoying enough, so I tracked it down to [MainFragment:153](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits/blob/2da72b1c2946c2a6f3486a3f3477eec18de7efa1/app/src/main/java/com/greenaddress/greenbits/ui/MainFragment.java#L153) where getActivity() returned null due to the fragment being in the detached state and crashed the whole app.

The (quick) fix is to cache the GreenAddressApplication reference in the GAFragment, such that when the transaction is processed by MainFragment it doesn't crash the app due to still being in the detached state.

I got somewhat carried away and refactored the whole usage pattern of `((GreenAddressApplication) getApplication())` to `getGAApp()` and `getGAService()` functions.

I did some basic testing and it seems my changes didn't break anything else, however, it would be great if someone else verifies that the app doesn't crash due to anything I did.
