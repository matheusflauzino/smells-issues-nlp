> Additionally the core library used by Android application is provided in form of compiled Java classes - https://github.com/BiglySoftware/BiglyBT-Android/tree/master/BiglyBT/libs. While commit implies it comes from https://github.com/BiglySoftware/BiglyBT/tree/android there is really no way to verify it. It also seems that Android application announces itself as BiglyBT 1.5 (https://github.com/BiglySoftware/BiglyBT/blob/android/core/src/com/biglybt/core/util/Constants.java#L159) which is strictly incorrect as you can see that 'android' branch has diverged from 'master' branch (This branch is 15 commits ahead, 16 commits behind master.). We are now in situation where two different clients announce as one and we're considering this to be spoofing on part of BiglyBT Android application to imitate desktop client.

Irrelevant of our no mobile client policy which is a part of why BiglyBT is now blacklisted, there is an issue of two clients that are going to potentially diverge further away in terms of functions are announcing as same client."

BiglySoftware/BiglyBT-Android,open,,Incompatible SDK API use which may cause crash to your APP,[],0,"Hi BiglyBT Developers,
I develop a tool to detect incompatible SDK API use in android application. Today I use my tool to check BiglyBT downloaded from F-Droid. My tool report many bugs. Although I believe most of them are real bugs, I cannot be 100% sure because I am not very familiar with Android developing. So
please help to check it, it must be very helpful to your APP.

The attachment below is the bug report that my tool give. please help to double check!
I also really hope to get your feedback.
thank you!

**[Supplementary explanation]**
There are totally two type of bug in the report. The first one is like this: ""API called in method not in [list]"", the list here are sdk levels, it means your app run under these SDK version can not call API because no such API in these sdk levels.
Type two is like ""API called in method no living level"", it means your application can never reach this API
use, so if these API uses are not in external library, you can remove it from your own code.

APIs or methods in our report are given in signature format like ""<declaringType: returnType methodName(paramTypeList)>"".

And finally, the reachable path is actually one possible call stack. it is always start from dummyMainMethod which is created by our tool. So you should read it from bottom to top.

Yes, many of these bugs seem to be in third-library codes. But it do cause problems in your app. Some third-library API say that they can only be run at specific SDK Level by using ""@targetapi(Build.VERSION_CODES.N)"", however, Application codes tend to ignore this warning.

There're a couple of reasons for implementing the panic button:
- Downloading torrents is illegal in some countries.
- In the case if a public torrent, it could be something sensitive.
- In the case of a private torrent, it's absolutely containing sensitive data.
