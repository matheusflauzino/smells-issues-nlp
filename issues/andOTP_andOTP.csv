Google Play

I've setup andOTP to use Android Keystore + Device credentials. My screen lock is set to Pattern.
When I open the app, I see its contents for a split second before the Android screen lock shows up.

If I lock the device and unlock it later on, the same happens: andOTP shows me the contents for a split second, before the unlock screen for the app shows up.

With Password/PIN this problem does not happen.

andOTP/andOTP,open,,Some Improvements,"[Label(name=""maybe"")]",0,"I'm coming from freeOTP and I noticed some aspects which I don't like about your app which prevents me from using it. Maybe my suggestions can help you to improve andOTP.

- The first thing I've noticed is the fact that I have to set a password (keystore is not working). Yes you can argue it improves security, but it is still 2FA. If someone has your phone and access to the app he still needs your login information and if someone has your login credentials and steals your phone to generate the token he might also spend some effort in figuring out the password for andOTP. Besides that if you loose your phone you should change your passwords anyway. But maybe it's just my opinion.

- The app is sluggish. Maybe this is related to the continuous generation of the tokens?! For example, opening the settings dialog takes ~8s on my Galaxy S5 mini. I would like an option to generate the token only if I click on  the entry, like it is in freeOTP.

- The size of the label is very small even with the lowest possible text size (12). I would suggest multiple rows or to align the icons on the right with the generated token so we have a complete line available.

I will continue watching this app, because in freeOTP I'm definitely missing the backup feature."

Instagram now support 2fa via App. They give two options:

2. Do it manually: Then they give you a key/code(?), you enter that in andotp and check with the generated code. Like usual with scanning QR codes.

The problem with number 2: The key has 2 spaces between a set of letters, like this:
ERGT  326T  MI3Y  6W4S  XXXX  GTHG  XXXX  FYVX
For me this didn't work until I removed all the spaces. I'm not sure if this Instagram 2fa without SMS is a staged rollout, but I'd expect many people with the same problem.

Just to inform you: looks like [CometOTP](https://github.com/gigabytedevelopers/CometOTP) is using your code without attribution, copyright headers removed. Even the README.md is almost literally identical, just the app names replaced.

If you can confirm it's your code (I just compared a few places, and they looked very much alike) I wouldn't be surprised. A little while ago they did the same with ""their"" file manager (FireFiles, see [this issue](https://github.com/gigabytedevelopers/FireFiles/issues/2)). Looks like they haven't learned a thing from the shitstorm they earned then, though we gave them the ""benefit of doubt"" at that time, considering it a ""beginners issue"".

Sorry for abusing the template this way, but in the past I've made the experience that if I deleted the template, some bot auto-closed my issue …

* take a look at the same file in your repo

Maybe this is the reason:
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider#permissions

I don't understand Android permission system well, but if I'm getting it right, I guess andOTP should ask for the ""persistent backup folder"" via some system intent, and then ```takePersistableUriPermission(FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE_URI_PERMISSION | FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION | FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION)``` ?

My os has not changed since then, so i assume its some internal problem.

After scanning the qr-code the error ""Verschlüsselungsschlüssel nicht geladen (encryption key was not loaded)"" is displayed. However I can add new entries if I configure them manually, so there seems to be no problem with encrypting the database.

* **Android Version:** 7.0
* **Custom ROM:** None

#### Expected result
**What is expected?** 
All of the 2FA codes provided by the app should work as expected.
**What does happen instead?**
The 2FA codes provided by the app are denied, locking me out of some of my accounts. This happens on some of the accounts but not all. Some examples would be my Discord and Ubisoft account. My Google/Github accounts work fine however. I can access the accounts just fine with the backup codes they each provided but the 2FA codes from this app don't work at all. They worked when I first added 2FA to my accounts but as the months have gone on it has become less and less reliable.

One interesting bit of info - my Amazon account didn't work with the code the app provided but without changing it the code eventually worked after a few seconds. Maybe a timing issue? Not too well-versed on the technical side of 2FA and how it works exactly so apologies if it doesn't operate on timings at all.

I didn't backup/restore at all before I saw this issue start to happen. As a test I backed up, reinstalled the app, and restored my codes but the exact issue with the same accounts that are affected is still present, even after doing this a few times.

Used Android KeyStore authentication. Recently switched to Password / PIN but this issue started occurring while using Android KeyStore. Might have something to do with it?

As a test I used a backup code for one of my accounts and disabled 2FA. When I try to re-enable, it rejects all codes given by the app. I scanned in the QR code multiple times to make sure there wasn't any errors in reading.

andOTP/andOTP,open,,Paper Backups,[],0,"This is a feature request, but I should have time / be able to implement it sometime this summer.

It would be very convenient to have access to a paper backup scheme for local secrets. Translation to words is convenient for hand transcription; most schemes get ~12 bits per word so the secret size is totally viable to just copy over by hand. This prevents concerns about accidentally saving a screenshot somewhere, printers, etc.

I would suggest that this feature should be behind some sort of password protection, to prevent the ""borrows phone and screenshots secrets"" attack. 

I think that this backup method (write down secrets and put them in an envelope) achieves a very desirable combination of security+convenience, and it's how I want to back up my 2fa secrets.

I understand that it is lower security than one-time backup codes; but as I understand it these cannot be implemented in a service-agnostic way.

Does this sound sane to people / is it a feature that they would also be interested in?

What happens instead is that the password-protected backup is successfully imported without a password being required.

Right now if you want to restore a file it has to be in the Download directory unless you enable 'Ask for Filename' is enable for both restores and backups. 

1.  I think 'Ask for Filename' should always be enabled for restore. This is also to confirm that the application is importing the expected file.
2. Backups should have time stamped filename enabled by default. This help with versioning and if we enable more frequent updates like in #46, it is easier to overwrite a backup that could be needed if the filename is static. If a user needs a constant filename, they can disable time stamps explicitly. 
3. One touch backups: Once the backup methodology is configured, backups should be one click and done. This is where backups should have 'Ask for Filename' disabled. As you can see, 1 and 3 conflict with each other.  
4. When a backup file is generated, it should show a transient overlay dialog with the file name and path. 
This is for confirmation that backup completed and info on what the file name is.

* **App version:** 0.4.0.1
* **App source:** F-Droid
* **Android Version:** 6.0.1
* **Custom ROM:** Stock Google Nexus 5

#### Expected result
**What is expected?** The UI could used a column or ""cards"" -based layout.  As it is, regardless of screen resolution or orientation, one entry gets one row with a whole whack of dead space between the numbers and the copy/settings icons.  If instead these values were stacked vertically (you could even move the `copy` icon inside the three-dot settings icon) you could effectively double the information you can fit on the screen.

**What does happen instead?**  The UI works, but for users like me with **16** different OTP accounts, I end up scrolling/searching a lot more than I'd like.

I want to stress that this is by far the best of all the OTP apps I've tried out there.  If I knew anything about Java or Material design, I'd offer a pull request, but as I'm more a Python nerd, I'm afraid I've not much to offer on this front.

I've got this though, a mockup I did with draw.io :-)

In the next release that should be addressed, combining the ideas I and @RichyHBM came up with we currently have 3 methods of doing this:

- [x] Disable all broadcast receivers by default and add a settings option to manually enable only the ones actually used by the user.
- [ ] Add a passphrase the broadcast has to contain for the backup to be triggered.
- [ ] (_maybe_) Add a settings item to select apps installed on the phone, only selected apps are allowed to trigger the backups.

I vote for definitely implementing the 1st option as a kind of first layer and one of the other two for additional protection."

This has been addressed before but was decided against due to the performance of trying to decrypt the database or having to store the length of the password.

I propopose the following(This could always be hidden behind a setting so it is opt in):

1. Add a dictionary to the app, maybe few hundred words
2. When the user enters a pin/password we randomly select a word from the list
3. We encrypt the word and store it in a file on device
4. We also encrypt the word with a key stored in the key store
5. When the user opens the app, and based on the minimum pin/password length we wait for them to enter a long enough password
6. We decrypt the keystore based file so we know what word we are comparing it
7. On each pin/password change we spin up an Async task to try to decrypt the file and compare it to the valid word
8. We allow the user to hit enter and try a full decryption as it does Currently
9. If the async task completes succesfully we automatically log the user in

This achieves a number of things, performance should remain, we are doing all tasks in background threads so the main thread should stay as it is.

We are not storing any damaging data unencrypted, and because there are hundreds of seed words posibility it would hopefully also be hard to brute force

Worst case scenario it loses the keystore key and you just lose the ability to auto login"

**THIS IS VERY CRITICAL!**

When editing the label of an entry and saving with an empty label, the app crashes. Furthermore the app keeps crashing on starup! **So there is no way to get it to work again without wiping app data**.

* **App version:** 0.4.0.1
* **App source:** Google Play
* **Android Version:** 7.1.2
* **Custom ROM:** LineageOS 14.1

### Expected result
**What is expected?** 
Either label should be empty or app should not permit saving with empty label.

**What does happen instead?**
App crashes **and keeps crashing on startup**.

#### Logcat
The exception occures here:

When entering an invalid value (empty or ""0"") in the ""Advanced Options"" section when manually entering details, the app crashes.

### Expected result

App crashes.

When you select multiple tags, it would be great that the result show only the items part of both tags.
For example we have various Google Account for various clients, so we have a tag for everything that belong to the client, and another one that belong all Google Accounts of every clients. It would be great that when we select both tags, it shows only the Google account for client X (the result that match all requirement)

**What does happen instead?**
When we select more than one tag, instead of to show what is part of all tags (search result AND), it show all the results of all selected tags (search result OR). In our example before, it shows all Google accounts of all clients and all items of the client X, so it is hard to find the item we look for.

**Comment**
Maybe can be an option to select both way to do in settings because it can be probably useful to other people to have it this actual way.

Though the Google backup feature is yet to be implemented, a new feature that would be really awesome to see in andOTP is the ability to set up authentication mode to Fingerprint or Face ID! 
Just like the way u added password and PIN authentication! I think it would be nice to allow a user to open/authenticate andOTP using his Fingerprint or his face, andOTP when authentication is set to Fingerprint in the dialog, an activity or fragment should open and ask him to enroll his Fingerprint, it should ask to enroll his face if he/she decides to authenticate with his face id, after enrollment, it should be stored somewhere so that when the user opens andOTP, a request for his Fingerprint touch or Face scan should be made, the moment the scanned face or Fingerprint touch matches the ones stored within andOTP, then the app should open to the MainActivity. 

I would have tried getting something by this week but I am out of schedule and having written some codes on this, am stuck at the enrollment because currently, I can only use the already enrolled Fingerprint data on the phone and not the enrolled Fingerprint/Face ID within andOTP but this would cause some security problems because most people enroll more than 1 Fingerprint data on their devices and I wouldn't like a situation where another enrolled Fingerprint data outside andOTP can be able to authenticate the app! 
PS: Same thing goes for the Face ID (I believe can be achieved using the FACESDK) and there should be an ability to reenroll or change/edit the already enrolled Fingerprint and Face ID data! "

Non Google Play installs of the app will continue to function as they currently do, they just wont support this feature.

This will also only work if the user is using PIN/Password based encryption as the KeyStore based encryption is under the same limitations as with using something like Titanium Backup.

Lastly, this shouldnt be used as an alternative to the manual backups, I envision this to be used more in extenuating circumstances (phone breaks abroad and you dont have access to your backup) rather than as a backup alternative.

andOTP/andOTP,closed,2018-01-11 12:19:26,Automatic Authentication of Users,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"Well, I setup PIN mode for authentication and I must say, it is just overkill, love it but a suggestion to help enhance it is, for the PIN, there should be a limit (probably between 4-10), then for the password type of authentication, you could as well set a limit too. Well, the password can be limitless (your choice), but I strongly recommend setting a limit for the PIN mode.
That's my first suggestion!

Then here comes my second, most important and major suggestion.
After the PIN/Password has been set, I noticed that on the page that requests for the user's authentication (when the app is run), there's no `NEXT` or `ENTER` or `GO` button in that window except for the user's installed keyboard, this doesn't seem right to me because I was actually caught up in the loop asking myself where the `GO` button is on the screen and where exactly am I to click in order to continue. To be honest, most apps I've seen in recent times that have some kind of security feature, they have a `CONTINUE` button that is grayed out if nothing has been entered in the Password/PIN box and only becomes visible when the minimum or maximum number of digits has been entered in the box. Lets take for example: U set the limit for PIN authentication to 4 digits and a user's authentication PIN is `5050`, on the authentication page, the `GO` or `CONTINUE` button should be grayed out/deactivated even if the user enters 5 or enters 50 or enters 505, the button should only become visible and clickable after the user has inputted up to 4 digits.

I would have even suggested not to add a button at all, instead there should be some kind of automatic validation that automatically brings the user to the MainActivity after the right 4 digit pin has been inputted, lets say my PIN is 5050, if I input 5051 (probably on purpose or by mistake), it should automatically prompt me that the PIN i entered is wrong/incorrect, then if I input it correctly, it should automatically grant me access...
This might be a lot of work or I might not even have explained my suggestions well, all that am saying is **""there just has to be some kind of limit (minimum and maximum) and a security validation when authenticating a user""**"

I have two Fdroid-sourced installations of andOTP on two different LineageOS-based Android devices, which I keep in sync and (thankfully) use to back one another up. A few days ago I updated my primary andOTP instance, and the next time I used it, ALL of the tokens were gone, like I had installed it cleanly from the start.

Next step, on the old, un-updated and still perfect version of andOTP on the other device, I saved the tokens to a JSON file with the Backup (plain-text) button and copied it over to the other device. On the other device with the updated version of andOTP, I tried to import the JSON file, and absolutely nothing happened.

So I used a text editor and copied the tokens over to the new version of andOTP, one-by-one, from the JSON file. That works, and the two versions of andOTP are now in sync again.

Now I go to SAVE the JSON file in the new version, just to make sure I have a copy of both before going any further, and the result is an empty file with errors in the Android log.

This is great, but I think the form can still be improved a bit:

- TOTP is a selection list even though there are no other selections, so it would be better if it was static text until and unless someone implements other options.
- I've used a few OTP providers, and I don't think any of them mentioned the period, digits or algorithm settings in their manual instructions. I assume this is because virtually everyone use the same parameters for now. If so, then to avoid confusing users it would be better to hide these options behind an ""Advanced options"" thingie (deliberately left vague) until some other set of options become the norm. For example, after a few minutes' web searching I was only somewhat sure that these were indeed the correct parameters, and re-entering a 32-character string plus label (for example if I had thought that TOTP would use the now common SHA-256) is not fun.
- I know someone must have put a lot of effort into the tagging feature, but it very much feels like overkill. I would bet not one in 100 users have more than a screenful of entries, at which point the tagging starts to be useful."

@RichyHBM is currently in the process of implementing the ability to assign icons to the entries in andOTP (see #14).

We decided not to implement an option to manually select icons as this would make storage and backups very large and a lot more complicated. Instead we will be shipping a selection of pre-defined icons with andOTP which can be selected. For that reason we wanted to know:

**Which icons do you want to see shipped with andOTP?**

If you want to help even more please link an icon with your suggestion so I don't have to search every single one myself. Please only use icons that are available as vector graphics, everything else will increase the size of andOTP to much. You can head over to [this](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos) Github repository to find a large collection of vector icons (searchable website [here](https://svgporn.com/)).

I will try to collect the suggestions periodically in this first post to give a quick overview. Icons I added to this post will be crossed out of the original post suggesting them.

congratulations on such a nice OTP app. It has everything I want in an app, so I migrated my codes from FreeOTP to andOTP. I wrote a short script to do this.

To run the script, get the `tokens.xml` file from the FreeOTP directory on the phone, run the script with the filename as a parameter (`./freeotp_migrate.py tokens.xml`), and the script will output an andOTP-compatible plaintext JSON file. Just restore that and you're done.

I was migrating from Google Autenticator, so I've copied its sqlite database from /data/data/** and created `otp_accounts.json` file in the format andOTP expects. However, only those secrets that were in uppercase generated the same codes as Google Authenticator, those that were lowercase generated wrong codes. As soon as I've converted all lowercase secrets to uppercase, they've all started to generate correct codes.

Following generates wrong codes:
```

This is just a reminder for myself to implement some kind of encrypted/hashed storage for the authentication passwords (password and PIN) and the backup password.

Until now both are stored in plain-text which is not really secure at all.

For the authentication it should be sufficient to simply store the credentials hashed.

For the backup password this is not really an options since the hash of the password is used to generate the key, so knowing the hash would allow someone to decrypt the backups. The simplest solution would be to don't store the backup password at all and ask every time a backup is created or imported. This on the other hand would break support for automated encrypted backups since it would require user-interaction.

Some options for addressing this:

- Only execute that code if `savedInstanceState` is `null`. This requires re-authentication after the task expires (~30 minutes or until manually removed from the overview screen).

- Use `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance`, the Architecture Components' `ViewModel` stuff, or a retained fragment to retain your view model (entries data, a have-we-authenticated `boolean`, etc.) across configuration changes, retrieving it in `onCreate()` via `getLastNonConfigurationInstance()`, and only re-authenticate if we need to load the data again

- Block configuration changes in the manifest via `android:configChanges` on the `<activity>` element. Personally, I don't recommend this option.

- Say that this behavior is working as intended. :-)

My idea is to add a master password option to the app and encrypt the backup using that master password (like password manager apps are doing)


This help the people who are not using OpenPGP.


Current issues :

1) Already password/lock option is available.

Solution : For this implimentation we need to remove the current lock method we are using in the app (using the device default lock method )
