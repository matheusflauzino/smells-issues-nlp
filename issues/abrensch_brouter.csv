abrensch/brouter,open,,Crossing nogo sometimes result in weird route,[],0,"Hi,

Sometimes, when adding a nogo circle, the resulting route can be quite unexpected.

Here is an example:

http://brouter.de/brouter-web/#map=19/48.81771/2.32037/OpenStreetMap&lonlats=2.319322,48.817627|2.320454,48.817373&nogos=2.319818,48.81764,25

Without the nogo, the route looks like (as expected)
<img width=""705"" alt=""capture d ecran 2018-12-03 a 11 43 47"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3856586/49369059-c86d7280-f6f0-11e8-8cfe-2695a9dab85e.png"">

With the nogo, the route looks like
<img width=""706"" alt=""capture d ecran 2018-12-03 a 11 43 43"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3856586/49369120-f357c680-f6f0-11e8-9963-36300608c425.png"">


This is quite unexpected, especially the right part where it goes **beyond** the end point.

The expected route with a nogo should rather be something like

abrensch/brouter,open,,Improve the trekking profile,[],0,"Hi,

Here is an attempt to improve the trekking profile while modifying it as less as possible. The idea was to really keep the way it is working at the moment but slightly improve some routes using all the available tags. This profile requires #122 first to work fully.

I'll comment in the diff to better explain what the differences are and why I introduced these.

I tried to find minimal tests cases for the features I wanted to improve, a bit like what was thought of in #116. My tests are written in a iPython notebook available [in this repo](https://github.com/Phyks/BrouterTesting) (please feel free to reuse / merge / write PR on this one if you think that's something worth it).

A static copy of my tests cases with detailed descriptions of the expected behaviors is available at https://pub.phyks.me/tmp/BrouterTesting.html (blue is my profile, grey is the original trekking profile, green is what I am likely to do as a human). The tests are, of course, biased towards the areas I am familiar with, but cover a bit of cities / cycleroutes / countries.

Best,

EDIT: The logic described in this profile is probably a bit lengthy and could likely be written in a shorter way, but I think it was easier to read this way, at least for a first review."

* Add cycleway:left/right:oneway (see #98)
* Add zone:maxspeed tags for traffic calming, the goal here is to penalize the ways without cycling infrastructure based on the average speed (typically, in a city, you'd rather take the slow traffic side ways rather than the large streets with a lot of traffic).

Thanks for merging https://github.com/abrensch/brouter/pull/120! I think I got the issue and the `jar` command to build the `pbfparser.jar` was not working actually I think. That's why it was not working with pbf files I think.

I updated the scripts a bit to ease building segments:

* I defined variables in the script to help change the locations more easily for users.
* I added a doc about the SRTM data sources and which files to use.
* I fixed a few typos (STRM vs SRTM).

The script should be working the same way, assuming it is running from the `misc/scripts/mapcreation` folder.

I tested it on a pbf geographical extract from Geofabrik and it works very well except for a few questions I have left:

1. I don't get the `car-traffic_analysis.brf` lines. What are they for (are they actually generating some output or just here for debugging)? It's using coordinates which are outside my geographical extract, so it's failing at the moment :)

2. Why is the `-DuseDenseMaps=true btools.mapcreator.WayLinker unodes55 waytiles55 bordernodes.dat restrictions.dat ../lookups.dat ../all.brf segments rd5` duplicated, once before the car traffic analysis and once after? (is it expected or is it a bad copy/paste or some other error)

I was having a look at map creation and the best way to create segments on one's own and felt like this part could use a bit more documentation (especially the `pbfparser` building process which took me some time to figure out).

I reworked a bit the `pbfparser` README with a bit more detailed instructions.

Also, there seems to be a missing argument to `OsmCutter` in the `process_pbf_planet.sh` script.

That being said, the `OsmCutter` line in this script works perfectly fine for me with `bzip -dc *.osm.b2 | java …` but it does not extract any ways (nor gives any error) when I provide it with a pbf extract from https://download.geofabrik.de/.

abrensch/brouter,closed,2018-11-09 10:31:13,lookups.dat request: busway tag,[],0,"Hi,

It seems that BRouter is not currently considering `busway` tag in OSM data. Then, a route such as http://www.brouter.de/brouter-web/#map=18/48.82360/2.32775/OpenStreetMap&lonlats=2.32672,48.82308|2.327599,48.823999 is highly penalized.

The configuration on the ground is a shared busway but the busway is contraflow (`busway=opposite_lane`). As BRouter does not consider `busway` tag, it is not possible to edit the `onewaypenalty` to account for this case.

What about adding `busway=opposite_lane` to the `lookups.dat`?

abrensch/brouter,open,,WIP - Allow custom nogo weights,[],0,"Hi,

This PR should allow user to specify custom weights/penalty for each nogo circle. The motivation behind this is that so far the nogos are an all or nothing feature whereas they could potentially offer more control to the user by slightly biasing some areas.

Typically, in France, a lot of cities provide OpenData about road works (a full list of the files I found so far is available at https://framagit.org/phyks/cyclassist/blob/34e0fec0165d3633e1d254f360fcd8c2cdfac78c/scripts/opendata/works.py#L304-389). Some road works might be a complete road closure (nogo as currently implemented) while other might just mean having to deal with some extra pain (only some lanes closed, traffic jam expected etc). The latter ones should be avoided if possible, but not at all cost.

I tried to take care of making it retro-compatible. Please note however that this is my first contact with BRouter code (and Java!) so it might be far from being perfect. If you think this is worth a merge, I'll gladly take any review and fix it to make it mergeable!

The code was tested with a modified version of brouter-web, so it should be working fine.

Thanks!"
abrensch/brouter,open,,Thoughts on profile development and testing,[],0,"I find it quite frustrating that #58 is not merged, but I understand the underlying issue: as a maintainer, how can you be confident that changes to your profiles will not badly screw up the results in some cases?

So, do we need a sort of test-driven profile development? Has this been done anywhere else? Here a few random thoughts of how this could work.

A test case could be an origin, destination and one or more test point(s) through which the computed route would need to pass to validate/fail the test. To ease maintenance, test cases could come with a short description of why the route is expected to pass there rather than elsewhere. Each profile would have its own test suite, but ideally it should be possible for these test suites to share common tests.

Should the tests be run against a frozen state of OSM? That would have the advantage of making the testing process more reliable and would lower the maintenance costs for the test suite. Or should they be run continuously as the map evolves? That would have the advantage of matching the real state of the map better, and potentially notifying the maintainer of any important tagging changes.

If we had a nice test suite for a few profiles, we could even try to derive profile weights from test cases themselves! Convert all the test cases to a big bunch of linear inequations, and let the solver come up with something.

I'm sure plenty of people have done similar things before (I am not familiar with the field at all) so it would be important to research what is already out there before."

I am curious about the algorithm to evaluate elevation cost. I tried searching around but could not find how it works exactly. Could you indicate me where to look?

abrensch/brouter,open,,Deprecated old-style multipolygons in OSM data,[],0,"I wanted to inform you about some changes in OSM data recently that might or might not be relevant for you.

OpenStreetMap has finally gotten rid of ""old-style multipolygon relations"". Those are relations of `type=multipolygon` where the tags are on the (outer) ways and not on the relation. For a long time this type of tagging and the more modern one of tagging the relation only have lived side-by-side, but now old-style multipolygons are deprecated and none are left in the data.

If your routing engine/data converter does support routing over areas you might want to change your data import functions to remove handling of old-style multipolygons simplifying the code greatly.

If you do not support routing over areas you might still be affected: Say you have a city square modelled as a relation tagged with `highway=pedestrian`. In modern multipolygon tagging those tags are on the relation only and the ways have no tags at all. If you don't read relations and match them to their member tags, you will not see those ways as routable. So even routing along the edges of the city square will not work. Details depend on the e
xact tagging of course, in many cases the ways will probably also be tagged with a `highway` tag. You have to decide yourself whether this warrants any changes in your program.

Our Github issue for this is https://github.com/osmlab/fixing-polygons-in-osm/issues/33 where you can find some additional information.

The problem: although both BRouter 1.4.8 and OSMAnd 1.8 install and download maps correctly, they do not interface.  BRouter does not find OSMAnd so a scan (from the ""help"" feature) is necessary.

abrensch/brouter,open,,Overnight Stays on Multi-Day Trips,[],0,"I've used BRouter to plan a trip from Munich to Berlin, which took five minutes to route, but gave a really excellent route in the end.

Along the route I was delighted to find camping sites near the route approximately every 100 km, which made this an excellent 7 day trip, but it was some effort to manually search around the route and add waypoints, so it would be great if that could be automated.

Algorithm I used:

1. Route without intermediate waypoints
2. Go to a point on the route that is 100 km from the start point
3. Look for a campsite nearby
4. Add a waypoint at the campsite
5. Check whether the first segment is shorter than 110 km
6. If yes, repeat from step 2 for remaining route. If no, erase waypoint, go back 10km on the original route, try to find a campsite again.
7. Finally, sanity check that the last segment is longer than 10 km, otherwise erase last waypoint.

Obviously all of these parameters (type of accomodation, maximum segment length, minimum length for last segment, ...) need to be somewhat tunable, and there needs to be a way to blacklist campsites as they might be closed or full -- in which case a different site needs to be selected."

abrensch/brouter,open,,Addressing negative turncost,[],0,"I was experimenting in past with negative turncost, initially on a user demand to promote winding to straight roads. It does the effect, but sometime brings problems.

I got occationally at Brouter-web   ""Error: error re-tracking track"". It looked mysteriously until I realized at Data tab some very winding way segments got significant negative Turncost comparable with the way cost.
It could lead to the final cost < segment length, or perhaps even final cost < 0, what is forbidden.

Ensuring turncost >=0 for the same profile and route avoided the above error.

I have already previously [posted it on Google group,](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osm-android-bikerouting/1UCxMVUW6zI) but I put it here to keep track, as I got no response.

I suppose this should be addressed.

Either not to allow negative turncost,
Either (preferred) by internal clipping for total segment cost >=segment length. 

The latter would still allow to have the winding preference, but would avoid routing error.

If not addressed yet, would be possible to implement conditional evaluation of variables as well ? As they are very useful to keep simplicity of code, but may cause profile performance decrease.

What about switching the paradigm from the variable based imperative one to macro based declarative one ? Assign would not be taken as assignment executive command for a variable, but as a declaration of macro expression. 

Variable=Macro would be evaluated only when called for its value the first time. Then it would get expanded to  `( macro expression code )` and its value would be stored for the eventual reuse for multiple occurences.

In such case, user variables would be evaluated only if used, what can increase performance of profile processing.

Partially for bicycle and definitely for foot routing, the current schema car/bicycle/foot fast/short  is confusing and misleading, if Brouter is used as the 3rd party local routing engine. 

As talked with the LocusMap author, the direct consequence is the application uses just one Brouter foot mode - the shorrt one AFAIK.

Users of eventual future alias/custom mode aware applications would be able to select from a bunch of self-explaining modes ( if profiles abstraction layer is to be kept ).

Applications not alias/custom mode aware would use standard modes as usually.
Applications alias/custom mode aware could use the exposed alias/custom names as well.

Predefined names could be prepared in cooperation with hosting application developers.

My idea is to implement one of or both partially independent ideas.

* Trekking Bad Weather --> Bicycle fast --> Trekking Wet.brf
* Walking --> Foot fast --> Walking.brf
* Hiking --> Foot short --> Hiking.brf

- if one is not veto'ed to create a reference-track, the other still cretes a veto for both, so at the time of a timeout-free recalc, a nogo is missing that was effective when creating the reference track. That also leads to invalidation of the refernce track.
- if a profile is changed, reference tracks using this profile are not invalidated.

So there should be the nogo-name part of the key for the veto list, and  checksum of the profile part of the reference track.

abrensch/brouter,closed,2014-09-28 14:40:11,incline dependency of cost-functions,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"There's frequent demand on having profile scripts with different preferences for uphill-, downhill- and flat sections. Part of that is driven by the problem of really steep sections that just can't be managed with a bike. This problem is adressed in 1.0.1 to a certain extend by including the ""incline"" tag in the lookup table.

But some people wish to select fast surfaces for going dowhill, but prefer forest-tracks for going uphill. There's not yet a solution for that.

Solution would be to expose a new variable for the incline estimated from the SRTM data. However, there are some conceptual problems here, partly due to SRTM-Noise, but also due to the fact that adding more context to the profile-scripts reduces the cache-hit rate for the hash-cache that reduces the number of profile-evaluations.

However, just adding a 3-state variable (down/flat/up) to the context should be o.k. in terms of the cache-hit-rate. The challange here is to define a filter to calculate a meaningful value for that variable.

there is a new [config.js](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web/blob/master/config.js) in brouter-web that chooses the appropriate configuration for online or desktop at load time. The idea is that no customization is needed after updating (assuming the config file is kept up-to-date in the repo).

Have you made any other changes beside URL and profile list for the online service?
Should the new all.brf and softaccess.brf be included? The softaccess.brf gives me ""does not contain expressions for context node"".

I would like to parse a custom profile for validation right on profile upload and send an error message (if any) with the response.
1. What would I need to do profile validation?
   Initialize a RoutingEngine? Are there any validations/checks afterwards? 
   Can I call `BExpressionContext.parse` once or do I need to parse with different contexts as in RoutingEngine?
2. Some exception messages might not be suitable for the client, e.g. `readMetaData` includes an `getAbsolutePath()`. Should we distinguish client and server error messages and e.g. have a custom ParseException with line and path members and custom getMessage/getClientMessage methods?

abrensch/brouter,closed,2014-05-24 18:57:05,Profile upload,[],0,"This is a first implementation for uploading custom profiles with the standalone server, similar to what CgiUpload does. The idea is to publish this in an alpha2 release and to expand on this in future versions (e.g. client-side loading/saving from PC into textarea; loading the selected profile / linked custom profile from the server as a template).

Some notes:
- new argument: custom profile directory
- profile text length is limited to 100000 characters (~100kb)
- file is reused (overwritten) within a browser editing session to avoid creating too many files

For testing, clone brouter-web master or download master (source) zip, will update hosted gh-pages after new release with the required server-side implementation.

I'm not sure about storing custom profiles on the server, fearing these might get too many and that users rely on them being hosted which brings some responsibility. What do you think? Do you see uploading custom profiles rather as temporary or as a permanent store where users can bookmark and share Permalinks to?

Use case is to provide the server part for [brouter-web](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web) - that would be hosted online - with the normal BRouter revisions (unlike my first idea to provide a separate all-in-one download).

The installation procedure would then be:
Install
1. download latest BRouter revision - as an example [a modified version ](http://www.norbertrenner.de/share/brouter_0_9_8.zip) with bin and segments2 dirs
2. download a [data file](http://h2096617.stratoserver.net/brouter/segments2/) and save into segments2 dir

When initializing the data for a micro-cache, extra data can be added to what's delivered by OsmFile.getDataInputForSubIdx without breaking the node's decoding. Here, a checksum for that micro-cache's data can be placed.

Since BRouter's cost funtion is not based on speed, travel time calculations would require to create twins for the relevant terms in the routing profiles (costfactor, initialcost, turncost, ...) that deliver the estimated contribution to the travel time.

Simplest way to achieve that is to use separate files that are referenced from the profile-files that are processed by the same engine but deliver times in seconds instaed of costs and speeds instaed of costfactors.
