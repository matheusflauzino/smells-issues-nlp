#### Expected behavior
Supposedly, When I open the app in a skewed rotation (landscape mode), the application will not run into any problems, because the application does not support landscape mode at all.

#### Actual behavior
Initially, my smartphone was in a tilted position (Landscape), and I accidentally opened the app, and suddenly the app crashes and bounces out. Next, I try to do the same thing by opening the app with smartphone position in the landscape, and the error still occurs.


#### How to reproduce
1. Install the application first
2. Make sure the <code>Auto Rotate</code> on smartphone is turned on
3. Next, tilt the smartphone in landscape, then open the app. 
*Then you will find the error as I experienced*

Prerequisites:
The app needs to be set up.
Optional - On ROMs that include this functionality, whether natively or by mods, the ""Kill App"" function needs to be mapped to a certain button.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Force Close, a.k.a. kill, ""Simple Weather"".
2. Reopen ""Simple Weather"".

Current Workaround:
Kill ""Simple Weather"" again, and hope that the next time it launches all will be fine.

Prerequisites:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a fresh instance of Simple Weather (by uninstalling and reinstalling, or by clearing data).

3. Immediately pulling the side menu, before the tutorial could start.
4. Select ""Weather Graphs"", and prevent the side menu from closing, or allowing the side menu from closing, and afterwards reopening the side menu.

This does not happen with version 4.1, which is the latest version on F-Droid.

I'll gladly send logs if needed, however I'd rather not make my location publicly available.


Update: I had manually downloaded version 4.1 using APKPure, and then I had set it up without any issues (I saw what you had meant by that the weather maps don't work, which is a shame, but oh well).

Afterwards, I went to update it to version 5.1, however XDA did not register the app as being installed (I presume that the XDA version has a different package name (I did not have time to check)), so I updated it using Yalp Store, and immediately upon opening, the app crashed, and would not open.

The same happened upon updating to version 5.0 with APKPure.

I even tried generating another new OWM key, but that one didn't work either. My key(s) work fine in Forcastie and Kodi, so I'm not aware of any issues with the key(s) themselves. In each case, I used copy/paste to enter the key without any typing to be sure it gets entered correctly.

Just for grins, I cloned the source and found the OWM API Key compiled into the program (located in `../utils/Constants.java`) I then tried entering that key back through the runtime UI and that seemed to work fine!!!

I had a quick look at the call-back code in `showApiKeyBox()` (located in `../activity/WeatherActivity.java`) and didn't see anything obviously wrong, but then my Java is rather rusty. It seems something is not getting updated properly or consistently, as it is very telling that re-entering the compiled in key works fine, but not a different key.
