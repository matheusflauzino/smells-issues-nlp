westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-12-05 15:43:10,Include crossing_ref in queries?,[],0,"While adding https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/1269 to the wiki, I noticed that some nodes have a strange tagging:
* https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1660432231 with `crossing_ref = zebra`

This is totally contradictory, as I think a zebra crossing with a traffic light makes no sense(?).
`crossing_ref = pelican` [as here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1531981700#map=19/41.88931/12.49638&layers=N), [make sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_crossing) as a pelican crossing just seems to be a crossing with traffic lights.
So, IMHO, the whole `crossing_ref` tag [is totally duplicating information](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:crossing) as it is tagged with other information, but well… it's used. The only thing that may not be covered is [that pegasus crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_crossing). Even the [toucan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan_crossing) can be represented with access tags, IMHO; and [whether it is a puffin is likely totally unimportant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin_crossing)… :smile: 
So far, enough ""exotic"" birds/animals…

So the question is, maybe we should include that in queries related to crossing/traffic-light crossing? Or do you think that we rather ignore it? Don't know what strange tagging combinations appear there, too…"

> It's often impossible (!) to solve these quests at daylight time when the lights are out. For example: Does a road light reach the (separately mapped) parallel footway as well? (It often does, but you cannot be sure until it's dark!) So I decided for me to disable this quest also and to deliberately reenable it if I go out for an evening walk in the dark

I do exactly the same thing for the same reasons (I even moved lit quest earlier to make enabling/disabling it easier).

* What I would really suggest is to use the [capital ẞ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fes_%C3%9F) ([English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_%E1%BA%9E)). This looks nicer (When I looked at it closely right now, I just thought it was written wrongly and only then noticed that it is of course written in capital letters and the ""SS"" workaround is used.) and also saves a little space.
* As for the Yes/No – these replies are so short, and you loose so much whitespace in the width as there needs to be this big padding around the separator line.
  Maybe you can put these, and only these two short items, on top of each other, so they are on top and have enough width (if you take the two columns together, I think, l they have). And the height has certainly enough space.
  Generally a more flexible layout could benefit it. Maaybe it could e.g. already right now just break the way too long ""Nicht beantwortbar"" on three lines and then there is enough space for ""Nein"" and ""Ja"" to be written as proper words.
* An awesome thing would of course be, if it could automatically add hyphens and break the words at the correct positions, just as the [hyphens CSS property would do it](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens), if it is set to ""auto"".
  A way to make this work without a big hyphenation engine (or whatever this is called – if something like this is needed?) may be to ask translators to define [soft breaking chars](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens#Suggesting_line_break_opportunities)."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-12-03 19:02:08,Make MaxSpeed quest disabled by default,[],0,"To confirm that a section of road really has no sign, the user is asked to walk to the beginning of the street and sometimes even to the next main street. Both requirements can be somewhat fuzzy for non-residential (through) roads. To _really_ walk to the end of the street/to the main street or perhaps even further to solve one quest requires the user to be somewhat diligent.
Especially casual users, the main target audience of this app, cannot be expected to be that diligent and may just input something they *think* is correct after a quick look. This leads to a questionable data quality. Looking at some random changesets during the cleanup (#1222) seems to confirm this.

Overall, the quest should be left to more experienced users which deliberately chose to solve this kind of quest. These users, as well as users who deliberately choose to solve quests where they need to go inside, can be expected to be more diligent to input correctly surveyed data.

It is a pity, since I put so much effort into the implementation over the time, but in the end I think it would be better overall, also in aspect of verifiability, to map the actual signs (as nodes) and only derive the maxspeed-tags from that.
Not sure if this is done already and it cannot be done with StreetComplete anyway, but I came to the conclusion that collecting the maxspeed data[ from Mapillary because of their great traffic sign detection](https://blog.mapbox.com/fast-traffic-sign-mapping-with-openstreetmap-and-mapillary-9914943460fc) may be the more efficient and in the end also the more effective alternative because of the missing overview and diligence one has while being on foot.

The message displayed when trying to activate the quest again in the settings could be:
_""This quest type is disabled by default because in order to correctly solve a quest of this type, you are often required to walk down and check the whole street for speed limit signs, not just the highlighted section. This requires a high degree of diligence.""_"

This would be a France only quest.
We have [three kind of police forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_France) in France:
* ""Police nationale"": civilian police force, centralized at the national level. Mapped with operator & police:FR specific tags
* ""Gendarmerie nationale"": military one,  part of the French armed forces. Mapped with operator & police:FR specific tags
* ""Police municipale"": local police of towns, under the authority of the mayor. Mapped with police:FR specific tags


### Checklist
Checklist for quest

- [x] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer (No spam)
- [x] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of elements (Worth the effort)

The kind of police is written on top of the building office, so it is quite easy to survey, even if you don't know about the details of French police forces.

About the last two items: as we just had a [Projet of the month](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FR:Project_of_the_month/Gendarmerie_nationale) about amenity = police, most of the ""Gendarmerie nationale"" are already ok in OSM.
But the quest will also be useful for maintenance because many police offices are still to be added.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-11-05 10:53:56,Adding building levels and roof type for cabin,[],0,"**Use case**
I've been going to a lot of state parks recently where the buildings are correctly tagged building=cabin. However, I've noticed that StreetComplete doesn't give the options for roof type or building level for these types of buildings.

I understand that cabins are not well defined and as such they are not considered for selection as a building type (See westnordost's comment on May 31 here https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/774 ), but for existing buildings I don't see why roof type and levels would not be an appropriate quest.

**Proposed Solution**
I would like to see roof type and levels added to cabins and potentially to other ways with the building tag.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-10-30 08:47:42,History in quests completed counter,[],0,"**Use case**
Sometimes I want to check what quests I completed, why? For different purposes, sometimes it is only curiosity, another times it is because I want to review if I make an specific quest, and occasionally I want to review if I mapped correctly the quest.

The first case, curiosity, isn't very important and anyone can check it in their contributions page in osm.org. In my opinion the important cases are the other ones, in which the purposes is different, but related: review a quest.

**Proposed Solution**
Due to the above mentioned, I propose to make the quests completed counter (marked in the below screenshot) as a clickable option that shows the history with the quests completed. I read #748 but I am not sure because in the undo icon the action needs to be called by a different interaction, like a long press but it can be avoided if we set this function in the counter.

Keeping in mind what @westnordost mentioned about how to show the items in the list I think it could be with one of this formula:

- Icon and the name of the element, if it has one, that had been changed.
- Icon and the position in the map. If there are several quests in the same position, as westnordost ask in #748, I think it is sufficient with the icon + position, nor only the position, because when a quest is in the same position it usually is part of the same element (for example, the same building or the same crossroad).

As a difference with #748, I don't know if I would include the function to undo quests edited beyond the last. With this suggestion I want to emphasize the history and not the undo function.

So obviously this is a pejorative and (depending on how you like it) a funny term. However, can we please replace it with a term in a serious tone? I am also a bicyclist, but the term is just inappropriate for these reasons:
* First, IMHO we do a serious thing here and we should use officials/serious terms and not some funny ones, because a group of users/people/ones affected by the tag, find it funny.
   StreetComplete should be regarded as a serious project – not some ""jerk"" someone put together.
* At least for me (the German translation – as I cannot judge the English term as a non-native speaker of English) is really unhelpful. Without the image I would have had no way to correlate that word (""Some kind of 'killer'???"") to the actual thing. And, IMHO, the descriptions should be helpful.

So I was seeing a power pol that looked like metal (from somewhat a distance, that's already hard to judge – as power poles are often also just in the middle of a field and thus not easily surveyable), but I could only select ""steel"" in the app. I thus wondered, whether it is really steel, and not some other metal (I did not want to add wrong data), so I did not answer the quest.
And as said, I think you cannot expect SC users to see the difference between steel and aluminum or so.

Reading [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole#Pole_materials) it suggest that steel is used, at least, but also some fibreglass or even granite (or these other ""traditional"" chemical things mentioned there)… :thinking: 

## How to solve?
* If we are sure no other metal than steel is used, it could be useful to rename the option for the user to ""metal"" (or ""metal (steel)"") to avoid confusion
* If we are not sure, maybe just tag ""metal""?

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-10-05 20:07:15,REPAIR incorrect data added with StreetComplete v8.0-beta1 and v8.0,"[Label(name=""bug"")]",1,"### What was broken?

In Version v8.0-beta1 and v8.0, the country detection was broken, it returned wrong results for a given geo position.
For some quests, StreetComplete shows a different UI for different countries and for a few, it also tags different things based on the country an element is in. With a broken country detection, the former could have led to misunderstandings by the users, the latter will have introduced wrong data.

This must be repaired.

### What needs to be repaired?

To repair, all changesets generated by v8.0-beta and v8.0 (the former has been released on the 16th of September; the versions have been blocked for upload on 4th October, 20:00 UTC+2) for certain quest types need to be checked for errors.

I identified the following quests to potentially contain errors (in order by importance):
1. **Max speed quest**:
  a) when answering that a road segment has no signed speed limit, the app tags `maxspeed:type=[ISO-COUNTRY_CODE]:[ROAD_TYPE]`. The` ISO-COUNTRY_CODE` may be wrong
  b) otherwise, in countries that use miles per hour, the app tags `maxspeed=[input] mph`. It may be that the app wrongly added `mph` or vice-versa
2. **Bicycleway**: The UI is a bit different for countries that drive on the left hand side and for countries that drive on the right hand side. Particularly, for oneways, the app only offers to specify if there is a cycleway on the _right_ for countries that drive _on the right_ and vice-versa for countries that drive on the _left_. So in instances where a oneway-road was tagged with a bicycleway, there may have been a misunderstanding and the wrong side has been tagged with having a bicycleway or not.
3. **Housenumber**: Specifically in Slovakia, the app may have failed to ask for the conscription and street number, instead of the housenumber (or vice-versa in the vicinity of Slovakia). This is half as bad though, because Slovakian OSM mappers usually duplicate the housenumber information into the conscription number etc., also, the UI is very clear about what the user should input. I.e. a user would never input the housenumber into the conscription number field.
4. **Max height**: Depending one the country on is in, the user is presented either with a feet+inch input or a meter input. It may be that user were asked for the wrong unit to input. However, the UI is quite clear about what the user should input (the unit is displayed next to the input field), so as in point 3, I think this is not a big problem here.
5. Quests that are disabled in certain countries, might have been downloaded even in those. Quests, once downloaded, stick around for quite a while, so this problem will continue to persist for some time. Though, this is not so bad, because the reason why these quests are disabled in those countries is not because they add wrong information, but by preference of the community. 
For example the Dutch don't want the housenumber quest because they import all their addresses from an official source and thus don't need individuals to map housenumbers. The cycleway quest on the other hand is disabled in in most parts of the world, because in most parts of the world, there doesn't even exist the concept of a way designated for cyclists. Same goes for tactile pavings at bus stops and crossings etc etc.

So, point 1 and 2 must be checked in any case, 3 and 4 maybe if there is a tool which allows to scan through it efficiently and point 5 I wrote here just for information.

### Help wanted

Help is wanted primarily so that someone could maybe point me to the best tool to find and browse through those changesets (find changesets by `created_by` with a certain changeset  `comment`) efficiently, and maybe even fix those in place without using another editor? Or maybe there is an even more efficient way to do this."

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,Give the user an option to fix the screen orientation,[],0,"**Suggestion:**

 Give the user an option to fix the screen orientation in order to prevent unwanted screen rotation, independent from the corresponding global Android setting. Osmand, for example, lets the user explicitly choose between three possibilities in the settings:

- Portrait
- Landscape
- Same as device

(The latter option could be the default in SC which reflects the current behaviour).

**Use cases:**

1. If the phone is fixed on the handlebar of my mountain bike, the screen orientation sometimes turns from portrait to landscape and back on unpaved roads, especially if I have to mount the phone almost horizontally in order to avoid reflections of the sun on the display. In these cases it takes some time until the screen rotates back to the wanted orientation. With the described option the orientation could be fixed - autorotation makes no sense here.

2. (even more important): Sometimes I walk through a region in order to solve some quests. If the next quest is, say, 200 metres away from my current location, I don't want to hold my phone upright but drop my arm instead while walking there. However, the screen rotates by 180 degrees (and noone is looking at it), causing an annoying delay if I lift my arm again in order to solve the next quest, because the screen has to rotate a second time by 180 degrees . Again, autorotation is useless here and an option to fix the orientation would be very handy.

**User interface proposal:**

A third line in the ""Display"" section in the ""Settings"" with the three options mentioned above (similar to the three radio buttons in ""Auto synchronization"").

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,Add bollard type to bicycle_parking quest,"[Label(name=""feedback required"")]",0,"Hi,

First of all, this might be related to https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/330 and https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/1038 where some arguments against having ""bollard"" type were mentionned.

**Use case**

There is no simple way to tag a ""bollard""-type bicycle parking in StreetComplete at the moment. These are to be considered as stands. See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Bike_path_on_College_in_Toronto.jpeg for an example of bollard.

**Proposed Solution**

I suggest ""bollard"" type could be added to the bicycle parking type quest. My main arguments for it are:

* ""bollard"" value is relatively spread https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/bicycle_parking#values (given the fact that this type of stands is more rare than regular stands for instance).
* As a bike user, bollard offer a quite different experience from what could offer other stands. Typically, a bollard is always not very large, meaning there might be conflicts if you park one bike on each side (contrary to wide stands https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Wide_stands_1.jpeg).
* Some cities are starting to turn bollard on the side of the sidewalk (for instance) into bike parking by fixing extra legs on them. These could be poor quality bike parking as the bollard was already there and not designed with bikes in mind.

Thanks!

P.S.: The same could actually be discussed for wide stands as well, which ensures your bike will lean on an horizontal metal part and which should be larger so that two bikes can be on each side without conflicts."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-09-06 17:10:28,"Repetitive quests, such as building types",[],0,"Hi,

**Use case**

I recently noticed that there was a (new?) quest type enabled by default ""building type"" (and related number of floors quest). This results in a lot of such quests to fill in, in urban areas. Even in Paris, where I live and would expect a lot of OSM contributors to have filled in such tags for buildings, this results in virtually selecting building type for every building.

I know this can be easily disabled from the settings but for a newcomer launching StreetComplete for the first time, this might not be the best first impression to have a huge number of similar quest at first launch. I would expect (but might be misleading) that the best first impression for a newcomer would be with some diversity in the quests, to have a general overview. Same for long run contributors which might be reluctant to fill in always the same quest. This tends to become a repetitive task and lose a bit from the gamification side.

I noticed this in a few places in France, probably due to the way the buildings were initially imported, without type or use.

**Proposed Solution**

Not sure what the best solution here would be. Here are a few ideas:

* The easiest solution could be to simply disable ""building type"" quest in France. This has the downside of having a lot less people filling in this quest then.
* A slightly more elaborated (and generic) solution could be to disable a quest if there is a too high density of this quest around the user. This has a similar downside in areas where the quest is most needed.
* The most elaborate approach could be to simply randomize the quests priority. This is not always possible as there are some implications between the quests. Typically for restaurants asking for opening hours and compliance with diets, this could be 50% of the time opening hours first and 50% of the time compliance with diets first. Same thing could be done with building types.

Hope this feedback can be useful :)

Adding complicated opening hours is often very time consuming, despite the input mask is quite clever. As a user who does street view while walking around the city I would prefer a quicker way. 

**Proposed Solution**
Probably the best solution would be using OCR: The user takes a picture of the opening hours and the app translates it into OSM tags. With the information from the picture the app fills the input mask as a suggestion. Now the user can change fields or save the quest. 
As opening hours are quite simple, it should work quite well.

I think the upload button does not really look like a button at the moment, rather like an label for the number next to it. Thus, it's not really self-explaining how to upload quests if auto-sync is off.

**Proposed Solution**
Making the button more button-like (shadow, other color etc.) maybe wouldn't really fit into the title bar.
Instead, at the first time using the app, a hint pointing on this button should explain what it does.
This hint could be repeated if many answers (e.g. more than 50) have accumulated in the local database to remind the user uploading them."

Anyway, this coincides with earlier findings when I worked on the [countryboundaries](https://github.com/westnordost/countryboundaries) library. During development, I used JTS for a point-in-polygon check and one query took something like 50ms IIRC, then I replaced JTS with some static function for point-in-polygon check and I was down to 0.1-0.5ms.

I took a look at the 3 tomatoe instances. Each of them was created by StreetComplete. I looked at 2 of the tomato instances, each was created by one of the editors listed in the osm.org Edit menu.

One reason for leaving a note instead of answering the quest is because there is something wrong with the shown geometry of the element:
- either an answer wouldn't apply on the whole way
- or the geometry is wrong
- or the geometry belongs to another geometry (i.e. in case of buildings)

In these cases, one would want to review the element geometry while writing. For example:
- ""the road is only a oneway south-west of crossing with Bakerstreet""
- ""the road does not make a turn here, it ends and a footway continues NE""
- ""this is not a building but just a building part of the office building to the SE""

This is obviously out of the scope for StreetComplete and I think it's clumsy to create notes all the time. An idea is to have the possibility to share the location, and then you can open the exact location in e.g. vespucci to fix the issues immediately. Know that it's possible to find your position in vespucci as well but this would be a smoother solution.

The current solution seems to be:
* clearQuests
* updateView (add the new quests layout on the layer)

Since it doesn't that updateView can be done faster, here is a possible solution (not sure about the feasibility):
* clear the solved quest
* update the new quests layout on a new, invisible layer
* clear the old layer
* reveal the new layer

In other terms, there could be two layers, alternating in turn from below the map to above the map.
My guess is that making the layer visible is faster than rendering all the quests icons one by one.

- [x] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose
  - Lets mappers and QA tools know the data is correct and not incomplete (as it may look). I often improve areas of the map based on QA results and almost junctions are a common false positive which take time to check (if even possible) and slow down mapping.
- [ ] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one)
  - There wouldn't strictly be an equivalent tag to say that two ways do actually connect, but a comment (or `fixme`) could be added to indicate that they do and provide any further information for mappers to use
- [x] 🐿️ Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary
  - Survey necessary when imagery is obscured or unclear. Easily answerable provided the user understands the question (would need to be clear that a way which continues for any type of traffic still counts as a connection).

<!--

If you are not sure about how one condition applies to your suggestion or you have (very) strong reasons that a condition may not needed to be satisfied in your case, just note that down. Someone else may come up with some ideas.
-->

To be honest I'm unsure how feasible/worthwhile this quest is, but I had the thought and figure I'll post it here for discussion in any case. I think ensuring the user understands the exact question could be difficult (e.g. a road that connects to another via a footway counts as connected) and - though I'm unfamiliar with the api - also don't believe the necessary element selection process is trivial.

### Ideas for implementation
<!-- If you do not have any, just delete this part. ;)  -->

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection:** 
You'd need to find highways (of appropriate type) which terminate on a node which isn't shared with any other highway; doesn't have a `noexit` tag (or barrier, etc.) ; and when projected forward by a given distance crosses another appropriate highway.

Probably worth looking at how Osmose [finds these locations](https://github.com/osm-fr/osmose-backend/blob/master/analysers/analyser_osmosis_highway_almost_junction.py)

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you even have ideas, where to get this data from, you can of course also mention it! -->

Don't believe so.

**Proposed GUI:**
Highlight both highways: ""Does X connect to Y?""
Yes -> Ask user to describe how the ways connect -> Add comment or `fixme`

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-08-11 22:17:16,Project website,[],0,"Did you ever consider creating a project website for StreetComplete?

## Why?

* When e.g. linking to StreetComplete one can currently only link to the GitHub page, which is not a nice URL long, and not really descriptive
* GitHub is rather a place for developers (e.g. you are always greeted with a list of files in the repo when you link to this project ""main page""), so as the target audience of StreetComplete are actually ""not-so-techy"" users, we need a friendly, nice and welcoming page, that keeps users away from the source code.
* Your project is certainly big enough for this, already… :smile: 

## Ideas

Some points I have in mind:

**Content:**
* of course, feature the header image of StreetComplete, note you can get the source images and some other examples/ideas [here](https://github.com/rugk/streetcomplete-ad-34c3), with `100vh` to make it look awesome :wink: 
* present some example quests… (to make users interested in trying out the app) 
* of course animation/video/gif in phone frames etc.; screenshots
* ""deep"" at the bottom maybe also explain OSM a bit – so users get what this is all about and why/where they contribute/why this is good

**UI/design:**
* should look-alike to the UI of StreetComplete, i.e. use same colors, etc. but it's still a website, of course
* to some extend a bit funny/gamified (i.e. there may be some small animations on hover, stuff with [existing] pictograms, may be overlapping outside of the page and e.g. slide in on scroll…) to present contributing not as a hard task, but as something you _want to do_
* maybe a map showing example quests (interactive, if possible, again) OR the ""in photo"" image mentioned before maybe just as an interactive example (it does not have to have the exact same design, simple map popups on hover are enough, 
* even if the example ""quests"" are not shown on the map, we may use it as a stylictic element i.e. just for design), because it is a main part of the app (in a visual sense, it's what the user will see), so we also have to feature the StreetComplete map style(s); maybe even in a _parallax_-style

**Marketing stuff:**
* currently, the ""tagline"" of this app is ""OpenStreetMap surveyor app"". IMHO, that's also a bit technical and one may come up with a better one. I know, it's actually not related to this issue hee, but once we are at it (make a human-friendly starting/launching page, instead of GitHub), we can reconsider it here, too

**Advanced:** (currently out-of-scope IMHO)
* localization (I'd say no for the initial version, but this can get into the long-term plan)

**Technical:**
* a one-page is fine, IMHO (there is really not the need for more pages)
* I'd prefer a 100% static version, or (if really need – and I doubt so) maybe Jekyll or another static site processor, but in the end it should be hostable on GitHub Pages, if needed. There is just no need for dynamic stuff and static sites are always the fastest to load
* we hopefully need not so much JS, maybe only for scrolling effects (i.e. click on -> visually scroll to part of the page)

## Examples

A simple, but already quite nice example is https://transportr.grobox.de/ for the Transportr app. Or https://www.davdroid.com/. Of course, the design is different than what I described above (and it is supposed to be :wink:), but it demonstrates how you can do it in a useful way.

## Howto

Of course, totally a community project. :smile: 
And I'd make a new repo for it, that's for sure. There this stuff can be discussed in multiple issues in more detail then.

And, @ENT8R, gotta interested? :wink: "

Version 6.0. I was at an outdoor park venue and the new building type quest popped up. I noticed two issues, one bigger than the other (IMO).

1. Permanent buildings for concession stands, as I understand it, should be labeled building=yes amenity=concession_stand. As that wasn't an option, I didn't know how to answer it so that the quest wouldn't be answered incorrectly by someone else. Can we make it more obvious to have an option that just says ""It's none of these things"" and perhaps just leave it as building=yes and put a tag on it for StreetComplete to ignore others that pull that quest?
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dconcession_stand

2. Permanent buildings for restrooms. These building were properly tagged as building=yes amenity=toilets and yet there was no option for selecting restrooms in the new quest that I could find. This is slightly more disconcerning because I checked and I DO have the restroom quests in my StreetComplete options and I refreshed the quests until I no longer had any it would download. Yet, I never got a single restroom quest even after I selected an option for the building quest. Is it possible that the new building quest some how superseded the restroom quests? I admit, I didn't have a ton of options to explore this on so it might be something I did. However, I did verify that the wheelchair access, fee, and baby changing were NOT configured on any of the bathrooms, but I did not get them as quests.

There are 455 486 objects (https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/leisure=playground) 2.96% have an access tag. At least in my area there are quite a lot of private playgrounds (mostly belonging to kindergartens) without proper access tag and when filtering out playgrounds in ie Osmand shows them as well.

Values yes, private or permissive (?) should be added to the access tag.

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,Add .travis.yml,[],0,"Fixes #1003 
The Travis configuration runs two scripts after each other:
1. `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` (works without any problems right now)
2. `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` (currently fails at a test related to the housenumber quest: https://travis-ci.org/ENT8R/StreetComplete/jobs/398136718#L3469)

There are two separate tests, one for API 22 and one for API 24.
In order to enable Travis for this repository you need to go to https://travis-ci.org/ and enable it for StreetComplete. If you want to, I can also add a badge to the readme which always shows the latest build status.
You won't receive any emails if a build fails but this can be turned on again by setting `email` to `true`

I have the idea to create a new quest for checking, if a [amenity](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity) is up to date (the amenity itself, opening_hours, etc). I am not sure, if it is possible, because the last update of the data must be check. Furthermore a new tag is needed for showing the up to date status and i do not know, if there exist such a tag. If the amenity is not up to date it should be possible to add another tag to show, that the amenity must be updated.

This is only an idea and should be discussed, because only with such a mechanism is it possible to hold the data up to date."

**Element selection:** 
1.  Search for 'amenity=parking' without 'capacity:disabled' -> Possible answers: yes, no, or a number.
1.  Search for 'amenity=parking' with 'capacity:disabled=yes' -> Possible answers: a number.

**Proposed GUI:**
Something small GUI similar to the backrest question for benches.
Possible answers: yes, no, or a number.

The same quest could be adapted for 'capacity:women' or 'capacity:parent'. But I think 'capacity:disabled' is more important.

---

Things to clear up (with the community), with which I could use some help:

1. **`house` / `detached` / `semidetached_house` / `terrace`**: The discussion in this ticket so far and in iD (https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/3976#issuecomment-296190581) made clear that at least the `house` tag can only be interpreted as a generic ""single-family dwelling"" while the others specify it more specifically. It would be in order to define a proper subtag for `house`, i.e. `house=detached`. This proposal involves deprecating (and bot-editing) the top-level house-tags and finding a reasonable subtag for a single-family dwelling that is not detached.

2. **`administrative` / `government` / `government_office`**: The fact that the `public ` tag is ""burnt"" in the way that it is not clearly distinguishable from `civic` arises the need for a tag that clearly defines a building as goverment-y / administrative (i.e. government offices should not be tagged as `commercial`, even though they are also just offices), which I guess was a bit the aim of `public`. There are several undocumented tags in widespread use. Someone would need to find out what for these are actually used, document it, and as second step, standardize it by deprecating the synonyms of the other.

3. **`offices`**: Find out why the tag was actually deprecated and if the process was actually legit (not done by one person without prior discussion). To this day, the tag is still used 70k+ times and to me, the tag makes perfect sense, as commercial is the general term for anything commercial (quote: A building where non-specific `commercial` activities take place.), i.e. including cinemas, buildings in a theme park, casinos, clubs, bars, etc etc etc. - a non-deprecatedness of this tag would also solve the ""it's an office, but a non-commercial office"" problem from point 2."

At least half of [those ways](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/z70) shouldn't have maxspeed_type=sign, as 50 kph/kmh is the default speed limit in urban areas, so those ways don't have a sign.

### Ideas for implementation

Not sure if the question is better phrased as:

     Natural language: Does this bus stop have seating?
     Tag: Does this bus stop have a bench?

Basic overpass link to candidate nodes:

- Fixes spelling mistakes (e.g. ‘housenumber’ → ‘house number’), grammar mistakes and inconsistent use of lowercase/uppercase words.
- Changes strings to use typographically correct characters (e.g. real en-dashes and apostrophes).
- The strings were a mix of British and US spelling. This PR changes all strings to use US spelling, word choices and punctuation.
- Adds a British translation (locale code: en-rGB). (This basically reverts most of the above spelling / word choice / punctuation changes.)"

There is plenty of room left and right for additional icons and if a ""newbie might answer it wrong"" is a concern: I think newbies might answer it wrong without such additional icons. They might answer it with 50 kph manually added instead of clicking thru all this menus.

But I think it would be a good idea to show the current warning for ""check for a sign"" the first 20 or so times a user click on one of the new buttons.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-05-12 17:07:21,right of way tagging,[],0,"Currently, one important information of our street infrastructure is nearly completely unmapped: The right of way.

Somewhat important for routers, since they can estimate the travel time much better when this information is present. Also, it improves the audible directions since you don't have to ""turn"" when a priority road is turning e.g. ""turning"" left and a different road is going right with the same importance.

I have actually no real ""plan"" how to solve this, but in the last time, we did some very productive discussions in the tickets, like in the building-type ticket.

Tags currently in use for the right of way:

- stop-signs as node in the road with forward/backward tagging.
- give_way-signs as node in the road with forward/backward tagging.
- stop-signs in the intersecting node with direction=all for a ""for way stop"" (USA specific)
- priority_road=designated as a tag on the ways

There is also a draft for a give_way relation:

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relations/Proposed/Give_way

I would like to hear some other opinions on that topic, since the current approach: Taking pictures and map that information at home requires a huge amount of time, instead of a simple SC-tag change on the go.

I wonder if we're able to come up at least with a usable solution to preselect a possible priority_road and ask the users if those selection is correct. On the other hand - I have no clue how to tag a road, if it's not the priority road :/

I can of course just remove the quest on my device with ""cant say"", but because it is not possible to set a number here, it would be great to dismiss the quest completely for streetcomplete. Otherwise, people will stumble about this again and again.

Checklist for quest suggestions (see guidelines):
- [x] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose
- [x] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one)
- [x] 🐿️ Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary 
- [x] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer (No spam)
- [x] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of elements (Worth the effort)

### Ideas for implementation
Start with basic information and go into detail laiter

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection:** 
```
[out:json][timeout:25];
  // gather results
  (
  // query part for: “vending=milk”
  node[""vending""=""milk""]({{bbox}});
  way[""vending""=""milk""]({{bbox}});

  out skel qt;
```

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you even have ideas, where to get this data from, you can of course also mention it! -->
**Metadata needed:** 

<!-- If you have any idea on how the GUI (the form appearing when the quest is asked) should look like. (i.e. whether a simple yes/no answer is suitable or what else you imagine) You can use any way to propose a UI. Use simple markdown tables (https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/) or complex image mockups. That's your decision.
Do include all answer possibilities you consider for that quest. -->
**Proposed GUI:** 
Proposal will be added later.

I will add aditional information on this issue later.

Looking at Taginfo (https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/bicycle_parking#values), stands and wall_loops are clearly good choices, but shed, lockers, and building don't equal the same percentage of usage as rack, even put together.

Man, the services StreetComplete is relying on are really crumbling left and right since 2018. I changed the URL to framapic.org for now, but looking at the statistics it is a much smaller instance.
My guess is that lut.im was discontinued because it was exploited. I don't think that StreetComplete would put a heavy load on framapic.org but if whoever made lut.im being discontinued through exploitation changes to framapic, this will not be a sustainable solution for image upload.

The most sustainable solution would be to have this feature directly as part of the OSM notes feature. Perhaps  the OSM core team would accept a PR that would extend the notes feature with an image upload?

I am putting this on ""help wanted"", perhaps someone within StreetComplete community feels inspired to suggest and contribute such a feature to the OSM core, it would certainly be very helpful much beyond the scope of this project because until now, notes left by (anonymous) users had to be independently verified. If those users are now able to add a ""photo proof"", it can be very useful in resolving notes.

You can see the notes I created here https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/bblipp/notes.
Interestingly, _one_ of the _questions_ I added a note for was shown again. I answered it and marked the note done on the OpenStreetMap website. It was this one https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/1282132.

Maybe StreetComplete could provide a list of notes created, with the option to re-answer them, or add more comments.

Is there any knowledge about how many days and if this can be influenced? “Invalidate Quest Cache” in the settings didn't help.

For now I changed what I wanted to change using the editor on the OSM website, which was actually not so hard than I originally thought. There has been a lot of improvement in the online editor during the past years :)"

Additionally, it would be useful if these quests could interact with the camera, like if you were leaving a note. That would enable quests like ""These Wikipedia objects with locations do not have pictures"", or other such things.

This also allows quest developers to have an easy way to develop quests before submitting them to the main project, since they can push it out for people to test. It also enables regional quests (like #639), or community-specific quests (like #904).

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-04-18 17:10:20,Task: Script that imports oneway-data dump and makes it available via a web API,"[Label(name=""help wanted"")]",0,"I could need help with something that is not a part of this app (=not Java code). Anyone interested?

# Introduction
Amongst other things, Telenav collects and aggregates data about the traffic flow direction of likely oneway roads that have not been tagged as `oneway=yes` in OSM yet. This data is available as a daily worldwide dump on http://missingroads.skobbler.net/dumps/OneWays/

This data can be used for the oneway-quest (#370). However, it must be made available to the app in form of a web API which can run on my webspace (Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, perhaps more).

# Mission
Your task is to write a script that
1. downloads and imports the [OneWays](http://missingroads.skobbler.net/dumps/OneWays/) data dump into a MySQL database daily 
2. makes available a web API to be queried by StreetComplete to get the data within a certain bounding box

In detail:

### 1. Download and Import
- The SQL table into which the data is imported needs to have the following rows: `wayId`, `fromNodeId`, `toNodeId`, `latitude`, `longitude`. Latitude and longitude should be the **centroid** of the given `LINESTRING` geometry. Only those rows should be imported which have a status of `OPEN`. Whether `numberOfTrips` should play a role there is TBD.
- On each import, the previous data must be completely overwritten with the new data. During import, it should be avoided that queries happening at the same time end in an error or spit out wrong data. (Possible solution: import the new data into a new SQL table, after that delete the old table and move the new table into its place)

### 2. Web-API
- If the query is an invalid bounding box, a HTTP error should be returned
- On success, a query should ideally return a json like this. If there is no data in the given bounding box, the segments array should simply be empty. It can also be a CSV instead of a JSON if you feel this would make more sense.
```json
{
  ""segments"":[
    {""wayId"":1, ""fromNodeId"":7, ""toNodeId"":8},
    {""wayId"":1, ""fromNodeId"":10, ""toNodeId"":12},
    {""wayId"":2, ""fromNodeId"":23, ""toNodeId"":42}
  ]
}
```

# Resources

Distance between two (on assumed spherical Earth) geo-points in meters, necessary for centroid calculation:
```java
// see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius#Mean_radius
final double EARTH_RADIUS = 6371000; //m
// see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_navigation#cite_note-2
double distanceInMeters(double φ1, double λ1, double φ2, double λ2) // φ = latitude, λ = longitude
{
	double Δλ = λ2 - λ1;

	double y = sqrt(sqr(cos(φ2)*sin(Δλ)) + sqr(cos(φ1)*sin(φ2) - sin(φ1)*cos(φ2)*cos(Δλ)));
	double x = sin(φ1)*sin(φ2) + cos(φ1)*cos(φ2)*cos(Δλ);
	return EARTH_RADIUS * atan2(y, x);
}

<!-- If the answer is not obvious, please append a short explanation to each item (or, if it is longer, below), explaining the reason. -->
### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see guidelines):

- [x] 🐿️ Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary 
- [x] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer (No spam)
- [x] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of elements: [See taginfo for amenity=doctors](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=doctors)

### Ideas for implementation

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection:** [amenity=doctors](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Ddoctors) without **healthcare:speciality**
E.g. Overpass:
`node[""amenity""=""doctors""][""healthcare:speciality""!=""*""]`
`way[""amenity""=""doctors""][""healthcare:speciality""!=""*""]`

**Metadata needed:** Possibly preferences for certain medical systems if prevalent in a country, e.g. ""Western medicine"" in European countries versus ""Chinese medicine"" in China, Taiwan, Korea, ...

**Proposed GUI:** Dropdown list with all possible value from the table ""Specialities of medical practitioners or other medical facilities"" at [healthcare=speciality](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:healthcare)

## Problem

* SC has inspired many to create tools or other stuff in connection to SC
* Finding all related tools or dependencies or stuff, which has been created for StreetComplete or is used by SC or is otherwise (directly) connected to it

This has the following effects:
* contributors may not notice stuff, where they could contribute (code), if they e.g. do not know Java/Android
* the maintenance of the other repos is not very good/few people actually discover them

## Solution
list of all related repos/source code/projects

There is just one question:

## Where?

* GitHub wiki (it is mostly development-related and still connected to this repo)
* OSM wiki (I'd rather avoid thta, as it is too much focused on users or OSM mappers, not devs)
* Contributing.md file (maybe, I am anyway expanding it and already include some dependencies)
* another separate GitHub repo (not really possible, because one would not find that repo then, this would require https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/928 then, i.e. the StreetComplete organization would have only one other repo called ""community"", similar to like [borg has done it](https://github.com/borgbackup/community))
* issue in this repo (note: very ugly)
* somewhere else?

## How?

IMHO it should be a small list (or table?) like:
``` 
* [author/blabla-tool-sc](link-to-project), used for XY/created because XY
* …
```

maybe structured a bit, if needed (i.e. separated in ""tools"", ""dependencities"" and ""others"")

It could e.g. look like this:
* https://github.com/borgbackup/community

## Why?

It would also have the following advantages:
* it demonstrates that this project has quite a community
* anyone can help by writing stuff in their own language, if needed for an issue or so

## What to consider?
* The list has to be editable by contributors (via PRs or directly).
* The list should be some development reference, not intended for SC users.
* It should allow attribution of the author. (AFAIK always possible)
* Contributors should be able to find it.
* anything else?"
westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-04-11 09:06:25,"Forced to enter (possibly) redundant information, suggesting new workflow for UI",[],0,"I have an issue with how StreetComplete gives you quests. Specifically regarding cycleways.

The issue I am raising is that StreetComplete is currently a contributor in adding ""cycleway:both=no"". This type of information can be defined as either implicit or unknown, but that definition depends on the commonality of yes vs. no. If there is a 50-50 split between yes and no the implicit answer is ""unknown"", if it is 90-10 the implicit is no.

In the case of bike lanes I would suggest that the ratio of roads WITH bike lanes is in vast minority and that all roads should be considered to NOT have bike lanes unless stated otherwise. 

Adding ""no""-tags to things is bad practice for most things, like ""oneway=no"", ""boat=no"" or on the reverse side ""motor_vehicle=yes"" on major roads.

----

Now to my issue with StreetComplete as an app. The way the app works right now is to show you the quests you have enabled in sequence. You have to do one quest in order to get the next one. This means that if you want to set something like road surface or lit you have to do the bike lanes first (I dont know the specific order but this is an example). That means you either have to go through the ""I dont know, leave not, yes/no"" ordeal or in the case of bike lanes say ""no"".

I would suggest that each item WITH quests to them should have an icon ""this has quests"" and let the user click that and pick which quest to do. That way house numbers dont block opening hours, road speeds dont block road surface - etc. It would simply be more handy.

That would make it easier to map while moving. Even while walking it can take longer to hide quests and tweak the app than it takes to walk the street, and quite impossible if you are in a car (or on a train - which I have tried).

----

tl;dr - let the user pick which quest to do on each item rather than have them in sequence, this will avoid unnecessary tagging and notes and allow a faster UI while mapping while moving."

With a dedicated bike lane it's might be easy, but with a sidewalk which allows bikes it's often not marked anywhere on the sidewalk. There's just a sign on each junction.

Even in the city they are often more that a 5 minute walk appart, so in short it's often for me possible to tag just one side, but I'm not able to just tag this side and leave the other side blank.

It would be nice if you could consider to split the quest in half, display it the same way as before, but let the user submit just a half completed quest. The quest should still show up, for me and others, to complete the other side. 🙂"

I've tooked a look at the data with Vespucci and it revealed no tag for bicycle lanes.

I've voided the cache for quests, just activated the bicycle lane quest and reload the data. Still no quest-popup.

The street is a quite usual 4 way residential street with a center divider, that's why it's mapped as two one-way lanes, but from the tags I don't see a reason why it shouldn't be suitable for a bicycle lane quest.

I consider this quite high-priority, as it prevents @ENT8R's [NotesReview](https://github.com/ENT8R/NotesReview) and any evaluation of the manually created notes by SC, which is e.g. necessary for https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/905."

>IMHO this is indeed a good idea, but currently not possible. It's something @westnordost has to do. (I mean, if I could, I'd happily just go through the issues and label them as quests.)

Also we may need to introduce a new tag then, so we can mark quests as ""accpeted"". (just a green ""accented quest"" would do) Then we can have really ~three~ four states:

* ""quest"" + open = a quest to be discussed/no consensus reached
* ""quest"" + closed = a quest, which has been declined
* ""quest"" + open + ""accepted quest"" = a quest, whcih has been accepted 
* ""quest"" + closed + ""accepted quest"" = a quest, which has been implemented

IMHO the ""accepted quest"" does not need to be re-labelled for old quests, as that does not really matter. When one needs to see implemented quests, there is the wiki.
The ""accepted quest"" label is only important for open quests, in order to determinate whether the discussion is still ongoing of whether this should be implemented, or a PR can be made (or, if @westnordost assigns himself, he implements it).

I propose multiple bikes arranged behind each other (just two or three).

I'll take this one, if it is ok.

If that is done we have an unique icon for each quest. I think that's how it is supposed to be. (see https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/998)"

And, yes, it would be nice, but IMHO it is really a fundamental thing for SC and it's users.

So I advise to change the guide to require such a difference. And if it is just the background color, as for the wheelchair acessibility quests, such a small change is enough.

With a small change (https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/999) we can fulfill this requirement as of the current state of the icons."

I noticed this when changing things for https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/995, which I consider is a first step.

Things, which need to be changed, IMHO:
1. Unify the location of contributing information. Currently parts are split in the Readme and an extra Contributing file. I'd choose the latter for all of them.
    BTW the link to the wiki is fine. Extensive information about one thing can (and maybe should) still go into the wiki. There should just be one place, where all potential contributors can look and directly find the thing they want to do.
2. Avoid long texts. Contributers won't read that wall of text in the Readme, they need short parts, bullet points, **highlighting**, structure with headlines, …
3. > I have a few tasks in mind that would be very helpful for the project, some of which do not require knowledge about the current code base. So best get in touch with me.
   
   Sorry, but this is not how FLOSS works. And also not good for the maintainer, as you won't like each one to contact you privately (via mail…) to ask what/how they can contribute.
   Instead make use of special tags for such stuff and link them in the guide.
4. [Also pay attention to the general guidelines](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#writing-your-contributing-guidelines).

BTW I can do this, so you asign it to me (if that's possible on GitHub). I) just want to gather the ideas on how it should look afterwards, first.

Affected tag(s) to be modified/added: [???](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:)
Question asked: **Is bus/tram stop elevated?**

The ""tactile paving"" quest for SC is already well known and likely quite useful. However, I think we can map more useful information for some other ♿️/ 🚲/... users.

E.g. whether the tram stop/bus is lowered, so you can go in easily. Some tram operators even show these information on their plans.

However, I have no idea whether there is a tag for this or how to tag it. That's why I have to propose this without a clear tag in mind.
If there should really be none, maybe let's introduce one. I think this information is useful - potentially even more useful than tactile paving information - but it's a useful for a different user base, so it's hard to compare.

Hi together.

I usually don't use a google-play account. That’s why I’m happy to be able using Streetcomplete in general by installing direct apk file. For apk download source I’m using link[1].

I would like to have a new additional menu item at ""About StreetComplete"" menu for manual update/download to link [1] in case of potential Streetcomplete version update.
So maybe similar to menu items which are currently available like ""License"" / ""Source Repository"" / ""Report error"".

What do you think about this idea?

The wording is a first idea, please modify to corporate wording.

\+ I added the fact that it manually tags the sidewalk, if it is not there, otherwise `sidewalk:right:bicycle=yes` may e.g. be there, without a sidewalk tag.

BTW the wiki is not clear about whether to tag `bicycle=yes` for the sidewalk (`sidewalk:right:bicycle=yes`) or for the cycleway (which may be strange when `cycleway=no`), i.e. `cycleway:right:bicycle=yes`."

AFAIK the right thing is not (legally) possible - in Germany, at least. The reason is just that there has to be a sign (or something else) allowing you to use a sidewalk with a bike. (this is ""explicit"", IMHO) Without a sign, you just are not allowed to use the sidewalk. This is not possible if you abide the law. Also, BTW, I don't know how a user may judge how such a ""implicit permission"" may be determinated/seen by the user. If there are no ""explicit"" signs/markings/..., how is the user supposed to see whether using the sidewalk is allowed?"

So it would be great if you could _hide_ the quest icons, when they are behind a building in 3d view.

> After one quest is solved, first the next quest is shown and before one can answer it, the same is hidden and shown again (with the quest icon as it seems).

Best reproducible with street quests. When you solve one thing, another thing (e.g. street surface quest) pops up and you answer it (if you are fast). But after you did so, it is hidden again and shown, so you need to re-answer that.
This results in the fact that I often already solve (click the answer of) the new quest when shown first, click on ""OK"", but often when I click ""OK"" the quest is already shown the second time and thus the input is cleared. So I often get the message that the form is empty and I need to enter my input yet again.

It adds a quest for determining the maximum height of e.g. tunnels or covered ways, parking entrances for underground and multi-storey parkings and of course height restrictors. It fixes #399, #421, #447.
Sorry for creating so many PRs in the last time, but I hope this helps to get the issue amount below 100 😄

Here are some things I have questions about:

- [x] Can somebody maybe proofread the [list of height units per country](https://github.com/ENT8R/StreetComplete/blob/maxheight/res/country_metadata/heightUnit.yml)?
**Result**: the measurement system is now stored in a [new file](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/960/commits/bd2f1943a3c599eed2bcf869d71f49c22629a54d). All countries and their units were checked while adding them.
- [x] If there is no sign, should we tag it as `maxheight=default` (used about 10K times) or `maxheight=no_sign` as proposed by the wiki but only used 14 times according to taginfo...
see [the source code](https://github.com/ENT8R/StreetComplete/blob/59b437425c51bacc9c0fd8c8b9866c86e4f474e2/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/max_height/AddMaxHeight.java#L66) for more information
**Result**: There is another menu for selecting the best fitting value
- [x] Should [the query](https://github.com/ENT8R/StreetComplete/blob/59b437425c51bacc9c0fd8c8b9866c86e4f474e2/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/max_height/AddMaxHeight.java#L47) be improved to add [the same functionality](https://github.com/mmd-osm/osm-maxheight-map/blob/1cd999d3d276bcef04224ccf045e0e81ec051a42/js/map.js#L282) as the maxheight map by @mmd-osm does? 
**Result**: don't add additional functionality because this might need some processing
- [x] If the unit is metric but the input value is an integer (without values after the comma 😄), should automatically a trailing `.0` be added by SC? This is also the current behaviour...
**Result**: Should not be added and removed

The quest looks like this in countries with the **metric system** known:

Currently, images of elements are quite rare on OSM, but users of OSM could greatly benefit from having more images. Images would improve the UX of map and navigation applications by showing the user what elements look like.

### Ideas for implementation

The user must connect StreetComplete to a Wikimedia Commons account before enabling the quest. The quest opens a camera intent and the user takes a picture. The user can alternatively select ""poor photo conditions"" if it is foggy or dark outside or whatever, and StreetComplete should offer to temporarily disable the quest. If, for whatever reason, they cannot provide a photo of the element, they can select ""can't provide photo"". This should behave like the ""can't say"" option on other quests.

Upon uploading changes, the photo is uploaded to Wikimedia Commons in the user's name. The title of the image should be automatically generated from the name of the element. The element is then tagged with [`wikimedia_commons=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:wikimedia_commons), linking it to the image.

Perhaps it would be best to disable this quest from sunset to sunrise.

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection**

It seems like the [query for the wheel chair access quest](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/wheelchair_access/AddWheelchairAccessBusiness.java) would work well. Also make sure to exclude elements that already have images from the following tags:

- `mapillary=*`
- `flickr=*`
- `wikimedia_commons=*`
- `image=*`

<!-- If you have any idea on how the GUI (the form appearing when the quest is asked) should look like.

**Proposed GUI** 

Show a large button that opens the camera intent. Once the user has taken the picture, replace this button with a preview of the picture and an ""X"" button if they want to remove the picture and try again. Hide the options ""poor photo conditions"" and ""can't provide photo"" in the ""other options"" menu."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-04-01 12:08:35,Auto opening next quest for object is confusing,[],0,"I think opening the next quest for the same element as it is currently implemented is not a good UX. (Version 4)

what happens:
1. I solve a quest.
2. It takes some seconds as usual and so already scroll/move the map
3. Surprisingly and without any explanation the map zooms around, back to my old position and shows another quest, which I have not selected.

That is bad, not only because of the delay, but also because it breaks the usual flow of sc (user chooses quest by icon, solves it, moves to next item). The user just gets a completely different quest than what he chose before.

E.g. I experienced that I of chose learn the quests by heard when you solve then. I.e. select street surface and first item for asphalt. That then goes so fast, such a _different_ quest is just an _interruption_ of your current flow. And, what may be worse, the user actually notices quests much more *by the icon* than by anything else. So when I get a different quest in such a way, I actually have to skim the shown question before I actually know what is being asked. That is annoying and I would not have noticed that, but it really seems to be that these quest icons (and tapping on them) are really the thing, where you recognise a quest, already think of the answer and ""nearly automatically"" select the answer without having to read/think of the question, because you already know that.

## summary

That thing is surprising, unexpected for the user and breaks the expected workflow. This does not seem to be so good.

## solution?

Maybe decrease the time until the next quest is shown, lock the map on between (although that can also frustrate users, so better don't do it) or show an indicator this is another quest.

Or, which I would prefer, show a number at the quest icon so the user already sees before solving one quest, that there is another.

BTW I would even go so far to revert the behavior/disable it. It is kinda counterproductive and could even lead to users actually tapping on the wrong answer as they expect another quest if think the first quest has not really been submitted. Only because I noticed it fast enough, this has not happened to me, but I nearly did so."

yesterday I solved some quests in a rural region with very slow and unstable mobile Internet connection. When I tried to upload my answers by tapping on the icon (I don't use auto-upload), nothing seemed to happen at first, so I tapped again and about 30-40 seconds later my quests were finally uploaded (usually the whole process takes less than 5 seconds). Of course I blamed the delay to the bad Internet connection in this area, but I think the user should get some information that his upload action is currently being processed. (My first tap on the icon was probably sufficient, I was just too impatient.)

UI suggestion: Change the colour of the upload button (including the counter) from the moment the user taps on the ""Upload"" button to the moment the upload has finished (i.e. the upload counter is changed to 0 again). This way, the user gets the feedback ""Okay, my command has been received and is being processed. No need to worry.""

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-03-01 09:17:13,Using alternative tile server / renderings?,[],0,"Hi,

The recent addition of the ability to leave notes anywhere from StreetComplete is super convenient I think, as it lets users fill-in missing stuff while also filling StreetComplete tasks. For instance my typical use case might be: I want to solve quests in a given area, and at the same time, I'd like to leave notes about missing stuff such as bike parks, to fill them later online when I get back to my computer. Previously, this meant having to switch between SC and another editor regularly, which was not very convenient.

The remaining problem though is that the tiles are super convenient for solving SC quests but not really convenient for noting missing items. Do you think it could be possible to let the user define a custom tile server to use, rather than the default one (in parameters, for advanced users)? This way, one may use for instance [tile.openstreetmap.fr](http://tile.openstreetmap.fr/) which features all POIs, bike stands and crossings etc.

Not sure how hard it would be to change the tile server through a parameter, if it's just a variable to tweak or if it is more tightly bound to the SC code.

Thanks!"

As you may know no names are provided for the pictures. i still support that as probably nobody knows the somewhat technical names for the structures. see #842 

Pictures may be to big, forgive me, im new to github ^^ of course i didnt map those bridges in osm.

(1) small bridges are not represented in the pictures, so its quite hard to pick the right picture.  example of a extremely dirty & closed one:

i had no idea which one to pick. if i understand the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bridge:structure) correct it would be ""beam"".

This one is probably ""beam"" too, although it looks completely different.

with the wiki article in mind - is this ""arch""?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/bridge_structure_tied_arch.jpg)

Conclusion:
Small bridges are not well represented, most of them are probably beam (?), just without the pillars.
For some bridges its still hard to map, as you only have a picture, and no name or description.

I may look if other people are more sucessful than me by checking the changesets sometime & search for more bridges in my area."

- [x] replace icon with suitable one once drawable is available (I may try making one but I would not expect very good or quick results)
- [x] squash changes (not done for now as I expect that something will be modified anyway after code review) (marked as done as may be done on merging)
- [x] consider railway=construction quest (it should be really easy to implement, but I am not convinced that it is popular enough to justify additional work for translators and for maintaining it)  (this one is marked as done as it is not blocking - if somebody feels that railway=construction quest should appear - after merging this PR and closing #685 a new issue may be created )
- [x] is there any other construction tagging worth supporting (except railway=construction handled by point above and construction=yes that should be eradicated, not supported)? (the same as previous one - just create a new issue after closing #685)
- [x] is it necessary to include all access tags from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access#Land-based_transportation or is it OK to include only popular, as it is done now? (this one is waiting for @westnordost ) (as I understand this one was based on misunderstanding and current state is OK)
- [x] add unit tests
- [x] simplify query - maybe ` way[highway=construction](!newer: my-cutoff-date)(if:!is_date(t['opening_date']) || date(t['opening_date'])<date('"" + currentDate + ""'))` in superclass will work as well as the current monster?
- [x] https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/920#discussion_r172029231
- [x] allow relations for buildings - see https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7405013

However, you also mentioned you'd like if F-Droid users can beta test that app, as they are more likely to report issues.
So why not publish a _StreetComplete Beta_ as a ""different app"" on F-Droid. Other apps like [NextCloud](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nextcloud.android.beta/) or [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe.beta/) also do it like that.
Users could then decide to test the beta deliberately.

And maybe also choose a different icon or so for it (as with the dev version, currently, maybe yet another color), so that users can differentiate the versions. (Or add a ""Beta"" badge, or so...)

I don't know if you use the beta program on Google Play, but you could also realize that on F-Droid, too."

I think that idea from @rugk proposed in #910 would help

It would (a) reduce chance that further duplicates of #910 #712 #439 and #537 will be posted (b) will help people able to use ""can't say"" menu that would not check bugtracker (c) reduce response times for ones that create issues on a bug racker."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-05-21 10:38:02,Spelling and word choice issues (mix of British and American strings in strings.xml),[],0,"This is just a spin-off of the discussion in #883. Currently, the `strings.xml` file has a mix of British and American strings, with a few spelling mistakes and typographic issues. Here we can discuss how to handle this.

I think US English is *usually* used as the default for English-based Android apps, with UK English provided as a translation. But it looks this isn’t a requirement, and in #883 there was a preference (?) for having UK English as the default. So here’s my proposal:

My proposal:
- The US English `strings.xml` will be changed to UK English. At the same time, any spelling mistakes found will be fixed (e.g. ‘housenumber’ will be changed to ‘house number’) and typographic fixes will be applied (e.g. hyphens used as dashes will be changed to typographically correct en-dashes (- to –) and ASCII apostrophes will be changed to typographically correct apostrophes (' to ’). I can create a PR for this.
- A US English translation is added to POEditor. This will for example change ‘cancelled’ into ‘canceled’ and ‘car park’ into ‘parking lot’. I can create the initial translation, but it would be nice if someone could proof-read it.

Even for UK English, there are spelling and grammar choices to be made. Based on the style used in the official Android translation (and in other free software projects), I propose to use -ise instead of -ize and to omit the listing comma in front of ‘and’/‘or’ (e.g. ‘red, green and blue’, not ‘red, green, and blue’). (There might be other relevant style choices I have missed, but I will mention them in this issue if I discover any when reviewing the strings.)

This message should then explicitly state that not all things from OSM are shown on the map and one should re-check that before opening a note…

Although it sounds to be a very specific quest, it'd still show up frequently in cities. I can't compute the total number of quested objects all over europe, but maybe figures from a few cities are representative:
- Vienna: ~ 150 times
- Berlin: ~ 200 times

Moreover, I think the quest could be implemented easily using the quest generator.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-04-13 22:09:21,Augmented reality support,[],0,"Yeah, I know, and kinda big and heavy thing and a crazy idea. The explanation is simple though: May we add a virtual reality mode, where the quests are shown on the screen, i.e. not on a map, but on a live photo stream from the camera?

I still see the success of Pokémon Go, and while StreetComplete is, of course, no game, but a ""serious app"", it may still benefit from such a hyped feature as augmented/virtual reality. I really think that has a future, and it would really contribute to the gamification. I mean, you likely won't use it all the time (especially as it is heavy for your battery), but I have seen places, where many quests are crowded and it makes sense. Also, it may be really more for showing StreetComplete to your friends or so and making a tendentious task more fun. As such, it would of course more be a feature for young people, I'd say if we need a target group here - a cool thing. In contrast to Pokémon (Go), it also serves a good cause, so we can also take this as an advantage. 😉 
Also there is no other OSM app with virtual reality integration yet (AFAIK), although it basically makes sense to combine map data (OSM, or, as here, quests for this data) with the reality.

It would also be great for showing what StreetComplete does/can do (i.e. when you show it to others, there is a wow effect [😮] 😉), as it is basically the realisation of the feature graphic in the Readme. 
And for the ones who care about the safety of their users, it also helps as they are more likely to look on the street 😉).

And yeah, in any case, this is a very low-prio thing and may want for v10.0 or so. But at least it is independent from the map library. 😉 

And BTW, this is not the [only](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/9#issuecomment-270203516) [similarity](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/183#issuecomment-299334841) StreetComplete has (or, aims at) with Pokemon Go. 😉 "

Either you make different columns for prios or just the usual kanban style (backlog, todo, done, ...) and then order it from top to bottom.

Dear Tobias (@westnordost),
so I want to say thanks for your awesome FLOSS project, StreetComplete. I also like OpenClonk, but to be honest I just like/use StreetComplete much more. 😀 And it is really a great thing, what you've built there.
So being a contributor, issue spotter (😉), or, at the very least, StreetComplete user for some time already, I also know some frustrating times, where I just thought ""But why does @westnordost do so??"".
But it began very nicely when I discovered that project in [March 2017](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/53) judging from my first issue. And what was is? A crash report. Well… yeah. Even on Cyanogenmod (seems too far ago…). Fortunately the app's ""souls"" (my award typos🙄) were fast to fix and I continued to report all sort of issues.
And, I have to admit, I sometimes proposed [very silly](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/525) quests, altghough [one was even accepted](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/484) (😜). You made it crystal clear that this wastes your time (you expressed it in a friendler way though) and you were completly right with that. So the community needed to find a solution. We could [ignore quests](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/525#issuecomment-325120503) or, better, [propose them in a better way](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/550) with a clear wiki guide and an issue template. IMHO the quality of quest suggestions really raised afterwards (even as more contributors came in) and it also helped me to rethink some of my own quests again.

Since the beginning I've opened more than 100 issues or PRs, invested really too much time (😉) into collecting data for an [orchard quest](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/368) – which I still have not seen in practise being asked (or maybe I am just always at the wrong position) and [created a wiki page of all quests](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete/Quests).
But you did the whole development work there, making StreetComplete a really intuitive app, combined with a coding style, which really cannot be done any better. And that's not just something I say, but something I've seen. Especially the good UX is impressing. I saw and now also always understand that you often needed to reject features, which sound great fat the first glance, but just were not good for the project. At this is great! It's great you keep the original goal in mind, keep the quality high and always think of the (worldwide!) user.
Another thing for any FLOSS project is the community. And I think this also accelerated quickly. Now you always have one or two pull requests open, you've got big features [implemented out of nowhere](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/pull/655) and many helper websites (yeah, looking at you @ENT8R). So I think you saw that being a maintainer of a more or less big FLOSS project, also always means caring and ""maintaining"" your community. And well… it seems to have worked quite well. 😊 
You could (thanks to your community again) even handle the one big issue in 2018 so far, the Mapzen shutdown, so I think that shows a big success.

So this is the first year I can say thanks to you at the #IloveFS day and it was not really not hard this year for me to decide that your project is going to be my year's number one at #ILoveFS's day.
Your project is a really nice one, and it is far more than a simple Android app. It's a project contributing back to OpenStreetMap (not only with data, but also with tagging changes and so on), it's a vibrant community for such a new project of that size, it's likely also a great way to learn Java/Android coding, but ultimately it's a big change in contributing to OSM for maybe thousands(?) of users or so. It really changed how I contribute to OSM, and made it a really a easy thing I do not want to miss. I think others see it in a similar way.
So keep up the good work and enjoy it!

Best regards,
rugk

When looking at a key's or tag's page in taginfo, one can switch to the *Projects* tab and see what projects use that key or tag and how.

Currently, StreetComplete is not represented in the taginfo projects. To add representation, there needs to be [a JSON file listing attributes of the project and the keys/tags it supports](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/Projects).

I've created [a preliminary taginfo.json](https://gist.github.com/goldfndr/7f66afc5b4628fcdd7e2bf3099053914) for StreetComplete. It's current as of the 4.0 beta, assuming that [the OSM wiki's table](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete/Quests) is complete (I went in order from top to bottom). Things that are needed:

- [x] Buy-in
- [x] A contact name and email (I suppose that since it's taginfo-specific, it doesn't need to be @westnordost ).

Something that would be useful is a 16x16 icon for StreetComplete; there are better artists than me here.

You'll see that I didn't include all of the `name:__` languages from the Road Name quest. If someone can provide me with space-separated list of the ones StreetComplete outputs to (based on the country data), I'd be happy to get the full list in. You'll also see that I shortcutted on the `religion` key.

I created the tags array using a spreadsheet. Data columns are Key, Value, nwar, description. Then in a fifth column, I have a complicated formula that converts the four columns into proper JSON, using the nwar column to look up the expansion (combinations I found are na ar n w nar wa). I created the data by looking at the source code of each quest. All typos and other mistakes are my own. For many of them, the query has a not (!) operator in front (e.g. Speed Limit quest has `!maxspeed` and `vehicle !~ private|no` in the query). I ignored the ! operator for those, rather than excluding them (or trying to figure out what the nonexcluded values were).

### General

We in Germany got many country roads which doesn't have center divider line and are very narrow. This would be a very useful information for routers, because you cannot drive that fast on those roads.

So it would be interesting of a unclassified road has 2 lanes, 1.5 or just 1 lane, where you need to find a wide place to pass other vehicles.

In cities this is a very bad idea to implement this, cause the lane numbers often change, which would make way splits necessary, but in rural environments this would be possible.

**Proposed GUI:** 

If 3 or more as answer should be possible we need to display the street like for bike lanes, to make it possible to select a direction per lane count.

I don't feel this is necessary, most lane counts should be below 3.

while reviewing my changes to find out which errors were not undone due to #849, i noticed something strange. If i understand correctly, StreetComplete should group edits into changesets by change type. 

However, 3 days ago i did an StreetComplete walk and added roof shapes and levels. The app created two changesets for this, namely [56188288: Add building and roof levels](https://osmcha.mapbox.com/changesets/56188288) and [56188354: Add roof shapes](https://osmcha.mapbox.com/changesets/56188354).

However, while these changesets largely contain the same buildings and were being continuously updated during the same time, some building and roof level changes were assigned to the roof shapes changeset. See this screenshot:

The highlighted building is completely missing from the levels changeset and all changes made to it (levels and roof shape) were added to the same roof shape changeset. This is not the case for most of the other buildings that were changed during that session (before and after that building) – their changes were split up into both changesets correctly.

Is this expected behaviour? It looks like a bug to me.

Jup, I disabled uploads for versions v3.3 to v3.6 and the v4.0 beta1 because it turned out that the undo feature was partly broken in these versions. Version 3.3 came out on January 7th.

**To enable uploads again, just update.**

Here is some more information on this:

### What exactly did not work?
Technically, the undo feature consists of two parts: undoing an answer while it hasn't been uploaded yet, and undoing an answer that has already been uploaded to OpenStreetMap - a.k.a. reverting.
It was the reverting that was broken. In the app, it looked like it worked alright, but in reality, nothing was reverted. That it did not work, you could only see by that the seemingly undone quest did not pop up again on the map. This is also how the bug was found today (#849).
So, in a nutshell, if you always uploaded your answers manually after your survey and made your corrections ""offline"" (if any), you can ignore all this, all is fine.
If not (by default, answers are uploaded immediately) and you remember undoing things in the last month, you should check your OSM history for not-actually-undone-mistakes.

### When is this fixed?
It is fixed now. In version 3.7 and version v4.0-beta2.

If you are here from **F-Droid**: Their repository takes up to one week to update to the latest version. But that's fine, you can still continue to solve quests offline and when the new version is out, upload everything. Or, you can also download the new APK from github. 

### How do I see my changes / How to correct this?
You see all the changes you made on https://www.openstreetmap.org/. Click on your name, then on ""My Edits"". There, you have an overview over all your changesets, ordered by date.
If that feels to unwieldy, you can also try https://osmcha.mapbox.com. This tool can also show your changes and does that in a very clearly arranged fashion. On Osmcha, click on ""Filters"" and scroll down to fill in your username in order to show only changes made by you.
Once you identified that there is a mistake, the easiest way to correct it would be to use the editor on the openstreetmap website, **iD**, to correct the information (click the Edit button on openstreetmap.org)."

This behaviour is present for me in version 3.6. I don't know whether this is a bug or intended, but i would wish very much that it was possible anyway. This is propably related to and possibly even a duplicate of #681, but that issue is closed and sounds like it was resolved. Still, undone quests do not reappear on the map for me.

Those operations should be split, creating a list with a prioritization sorting for needed-to-be-downloaded/updated tiles while this is diverted to a background process and all other tiles which are available are loaded from the cache.

* **Good:** It does not jiggle/dangle so much, anymore.
* **Bad:** Sometimes it is just stuck, i.e. when I turn around I see the blue circle moves correctly, but the map does not turn in order to adjust the direction

STR for the bad thing:
1. Enable 3d view and GPS locking.
2. Turn around heavily.
3. At some point your turns are only ""recognized"" by the blue circle and not the map. However, you can verify your still in the locked mode as you cannot manually turn the map.
4. In order to make it work again, I had to unlock it multiple times/move/turn it manually, before begginning with 1. again.

So maybe the mechnism to stabilize the view is a bit too strong. Or maybe that's not the issue as it actually seems to recognize it (the blue circle always points into the correct direction.)

It would be really nice if there were some way for me to answer, ""This road is exactly the same as the last 3 roads I tagged"" without having to click through the same dialogs over and over.

I seldom go on a trip for the explicit purpose of tagging with StreetComplete. Rather, I do it when I have a minute of down time while I'm out for some other reason. Speed of entry has a dramatic impact on the number of quests I am able **or willing** to complete before I get bored/frustrated and move on to the next thing.

I am not quite sure how a UI for this should be. I could imagine two ways:

1. A single action to answer multiple quests that share an answer.
2. A quick way to answer ""same as last"" or ""same as neighboring street"".
    - Could be for a single quest or for multiple characteristics."

I think the filter expression in the housenumber quest is incomplete. I have many houses in my neighborhood, which are tagged only with building=yes. For these houses the quests doesn't show up to set a housenumber. So maybe it's sufficient to just add building=yes to the filter list (HOUSES_WITHOUT_HOUSENUMBERS).

**Element selection:**
The filters should not just include building=residential, but also building=yes.

**Metadata needed:** 
It might be that building=yes is not appropriate, but often it is the initial value, if the buildings are drawn from satellite maps, but no local survey took place.

The existing GUI is perfect. It just should quest, also in case where only building=yes is tagged.

For now statistics about religions are from OSM itself. I did it for following reasons

- this way countries without real OSM avrtivity are skipped
- it automatically handles cases of religions maintaining more/less place of worship than indicated by its religion share
- it reflects interest of OSM editors in region
- note that as result of factors above it may significantly differ from official religion distribution
- data should be easy to update by rerunning the script
- I was curious how it may be done and making statistics from OSM data was more interesting than manually collecting data or parsing official data

Open issues

- I think that it would be a good idea to extract code shared by AddSportForm and formm for this quest. AbstractAddAttributeForm? (either as separate PR or by adding commit to this one)
- I wonder how script used to generate this data should be shared, I guess that link to file in a separate repo linked fom popularReligion.yml header would be the best idea (requires updating this PR to include link)
- AFAIK it is the first attempt to directly transform OSM data into country data files - hopefully it is OK 
  - if for some reason data for all countries is needed, even ones without OSM editors I may try parsing some statistics like one from https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/777#issuecomment-360528897
  - using official statistics would also be necessary if order on list is supposed to follow official statistics, rather how many amenity=place_of_worship of given religion are mapped in a given country

Reuse #777

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you even have ideas, where to get this data from, you can of course also mention it! -->
**Metadata needed:** 
yes it is necessary and I may supply it (for areas that are already mapped in OSM)

<!-- If you have any idea on how the GUI (the from appearing when the quest is asked) should look like. (i.e. whether a simple yes/no answer is suitable or what else you imagine) You can use any way to propose a UI. Use simple markdown tables (https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/) or complex image mockups. That's your decision.
Do include all answer possibilities you consider for that quest. -->
**Proposed GUI:** 

Reuse #777, but without allowing to  supply info about denomination (as it is extremely tricky to get this right for some shrines)

The [English tactile_paving Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:tactile_paving) says ""When a footway next to a road ends at a crossing with a lowered kerb (kerb), tactile_paving is often used to indicate the dangerous spot tactile_paving=yes."" If the crosswalk doesn't have tactile paving along its length then there is no ""dangerous spot"" in the middle of the road, to my reading.

**Comment:** The privacy issue here is that more or less detailed movement profiles could be constructed. Sure, when uploading to OpenStreetMap, the timestamp of this moment when the uploading took place is automatically included by the OpenStreetMap server. But users can wait some hours or days before uploading if they want to protect some of their location privacy.

**Suggestion:** I suggest to give the image a random filename. Date and time are not needed, and are anyway only included in the filename, which most people won't spot.

I already implemented two quests (one for tactile pavings (see #750) and another for post box collection times (see #85))

The position of the quests is downloaded via overpass so the user can e.g. look whether a post box in his country has really collection times... Once a question is answered, all other quests of the same type automatically disappear so the user can't answer one question multiple times.

Is it possible to display any additional information that might help me make a decision? Either explicitly clarifying about suburbs in the question, or providing context so I can understand the effect of each choice (What's the in/out of town speed limit?

I have no familiarity with OSM terms. There are two parts to the question that are confusing to me:

1. ""Not a proper road"" vs ""It has no name"" -- what is a ""proper road""?
    - My first instinct was to say it's not a proper road, since it's only 30 feet long. As I think about it more, I think that's wrong, though, since people do drive on it like a normal road.
2. If it is a road, does it have a name?
    - It has no sign, so I'm inclined to say no name. However, I could also see the rationale for putting the name of the road it comes off of.
3. What is a track?
    - As I mentioned, my instinct was to mark it as not a proper road. So now I see my options are a service road, a track, or something else. But I'm not sure what a track is, so I can't answer the question.

Roads segments can be quite long and _it looks like_ the marker is located at a fixed position on the middle-point/centroid of the linear features.

Suggestions:
- add several markers, regularly spaced on the line (space may be zoom-dependant)
- see if the marker position can be floating, anywhere on the line, to dynamically choose the position on the line, within the screen, without colliding too much with others markers/labels."

Also, I hope, by default the right side is added, is not it? That is not obvious from the UI as it shows the cycleway at the top (and the ""other side"" at the bottom) of that image.

Maybe you can turn this for 90°, so the right side is really right from the users point of view. And the left site is left. This would then also match the road when walking/driving/… the road as it exactly matches the ""real world situation"" the user is currently seeing.
And when there is e.g. a cycleway only on the left, the user then sees this immediately, instead of maybe inadvertently adding a wrong value. So you could prevent some accidental changes.

Also the user has to be aware not to add the left side cycleway, if the street in the other direction is mapped separately. I don't know a solution for that, maybe we can just assume the user is clever enough to see that (if there are two streets on the map), but it is still a point of failure. Especially as you have to imagine users with no knowledge of OSM – they likely won't know streets can also be mapped separately using one-ways.

So the first two things can be solved with small UI tweaks, the last thing may be more complex and I'd don't argue to change anything there. Just wanting to let you know…"

I read with interest this article on [Mark your street asphalted and earn Bitcoins](http://www.thomas-liebig.eu/wordpress/mark-your-street-asphalted-and-earn-bitcoins/) and immediately thought of StreetComplete which it might be possible to extend and incorporate such functionality.

In France, in Paris, very often there are small portions of streets in OSM connecting two larger portions, whereas it is actually a single physical street. See for instance https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/140033649#map=19/48.84118/2.38965&layers=N. Looking at the map, it is obvious that this segment is part of ""Avenue Daumesnil"" with neighbouring segments.

StreetComplete asks to fill-in quests for every segments of the street, including this small portion, and that's usually fine. However, it could be sometimes quite unclear for a total newcomer how to best fill-in these quests. For instance, for speed limits, should they fill-in the speed only on the segment where the sign physically is (and set ""No sign"" on any other segments)? Or extrapolate from the signs in the real world to set the correct speed limits accordingly?"

First of all, thanks for the amazingly usefull app! You're not far away of 1 million edits.

A small usability error that I encountered was the not automatic updating of quests. 

I scanned for quests once. In the mean time, I've fixed a lot of road surfaces in parallel, with another editor. However, the 'What is this road surface?' quests were still shown in StreetComplete, even weeks later. That was until I realized what happened and rescanned for quests on my entire city.

This could be more polished; e.g. by auto updating the quests every once in a while. I would propose that quests would 
- Attempt to update daily for 'wifi-only' and 'constant syncing'-users, for a bounding box of around one or two kilometer around the user.

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,Width of a cycleway/cyclelane,"[Label(name=""new quest"")]",0,"### General

Another factor in the comfort of cyclists is the width of a cycleway/cyclelane. A two meter cycleway is way nicer to drive then a 1m one.

**Example question**: `What is the width of this cycleway (in meters)?`

Affected key(s) (or tags) to be modified: [width](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width)

**This is not an easy question**. Users should have a measuring tape on them. Therefore, I propose that this quest be disabled by default.
Furthermore, measuring widths of cycleways can hinder other cyclists or can be dangerous. A warning message should be included.

### Ideas for implementation

**Element selection:** 

        way[""cycleway""][""width""!~"".*""][""cycleway:width""!~"".*""]({{bbox}});
        way[""cycleway:left""][""cycleway:left:width""!~"".*""]({{bbox}});
        way[""cycleway:right""][""cycleway:right:width""!~"".*""]({{bbox}});




**Proposed GUI:** a number field.

It should show a few examples of how to measure, e.g.

        -----------+
                     |                +-----------------------------------------------------------+----+
                     +-------------+          (cyclepath)     (line defining cycleway    ^  )

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-11-20 15:43:30,Surface of a cycleway (and perhaps footpath),[],0,"### General

**Example question**: `What is the surface of this cycleway?`

Not only car drivers like to know the surface of the road - also cyclists are impacted by the surface of a cycleway. A smooth asphalt pavement is more comfortable then a sett surface to drive on.

Therefore I propose to extend the 'surface of road' quest to cycleways as well.

This quest could be a seperate quest from the surface. The icon could be the same, with a small bicycle overlaid. This way, persons never taking the bike can disable it.

**Proposed GUI:** same as surface quest

1. Filtering and reordering quests was added 13 days ago;
2. Vegan/vegetarian and car wash quests were added 3 days ago;

I was excited to update to 3.0 today only to find that none of these things were actually translated in the interface. Turns out, there are two reasons for that:

- exhibit 2 is not translated because it only today got into POEditor, not sure why it's been so slow, but here we go. I saw it there only 12 or so hours ago. Did other people have enough time to even see it? Well, let's go to https://poeditor.com/join/project/IE4GC127Ki and see that almost every language sits at around 90% on average, only German and English (the source language) is at 100%.
- exhibit 1 is more interesting. Why am I not seeing things I definitely got translated a week ago? Oh yeah, you'll notice that values-ru is not in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/commit/c78917e8396399b5c028cee6d880978fd451a71a and I bet some other languages too - after all, it only updates 8 files, one of them being values/strings.xml (source)."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-11-15 18:36:59,Support for Czech/Slovak addressing system,[],0,"*(copying and pasting from a [mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/osm_sk/8bdf928c-c1e7-43ea-8fe7-952b0e2d6d53%40googlegroups.com))*

I would be great if you could add support for the Czech/Slovak house number scheme to
StreetComplete, for the moment enabling it in Slovakia only (since the Czech community is currently against enabling this)? <sup>[0]</sup>

Unfortunately, there isn't any good documentation in English, but you myself and others can help you with this. Basically, there's one number (*conscription number*) which is normally unique to the place or its district, depending on the city, and another number (*street number*) is the regular street number; neither is normally rendered. Unless street numbers aren't used (which mostly what happens in villages), `addr:housenumber` is better be set to the street number, for rendering purposes. In villages it's quite often that houses don't get any street numbers, so when conscription number only is used, it is copied to `addr:housenumber`.

The street signs in Slovakia normally look like this:

![2017-11-14_12-36-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/309253/32777975-94b7c814-c938-11e7-86b8-87e651ae348e.png)

The black sign is the conscription number, the red one is a street number.

In some cases, the conscription number is prepended by a red Roman numeral denoting the city district:

![2017-11-14_12-38-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/309253/32778074-d4375ac2-c938-11e7-817a-71dd9710ca94.png)

I would expect from StreetComplete to display two house number boxes separated by a slash:

`[     ]/[   ]`

with the first of them corresponding to the conscription number, and the second being the street number. For Slovakia, it's be also cool if they could be coloured differently, in the same way the real street signs are coloured (conscription numbers are black on white, street numbers are red on white).

In Czech republic, unfortunately, there isn't a country-wide standard for the house number signs, so this colour scheme may not work.

Alternatively, StreetComplete might display the same UI as elsewhere, but recognise house numbers with a slash in Slovakia and fill `addr:conscriptionnumber`/`addr:streetnumber` fields accordingly when saving changes.

Rassurez-vous, l\'application ne diffuse pas votre localisation. </p>  <p><b>Utilisation des données</b></p> <p> Comme mentionné, l\'application communique directement avec l\'infrastructure OSM. C\'est-à-dire avec l\'<a href=\""http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API\"">API Overpass</a> pour télécharger des quêtes (ce qui est anonyme) et avec l\'<a href=\""http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6\"">API OSM</a> pour sauvegarder vos modifications.<br/> Cependant, avant de sauvegarder vos modifications, l\'application vérifie avec un <a href=\""http://www.westnordost.de/streetcomplete/banned_versions.txt\"">fichier texte</a> sur mon serveur si elle a été interdite d\'envoyer des modifications. C\'est une mesure de précaution pour éviter de retirer de la circulation des versions de l\'application qui avaient des bogues critiques risquant de corrompre les données OSM.<br/> </p> <p> Pour afficher la carte, les tuiles vectorielles sont extraites du <a href=\""https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles/\"">service de tuiles de Mapzen</a>, ce qui est anonyme. Le service enregistre les requêtes de tuiles pour savoir quelles sont les zones les plus populaires pour la pré-mise en cache et les améliorations de performances. Leur plate-forme enregistre également votre adresse IP, et tout leur hébergement est chez Amazon, ils sont donc dépendant de leur propre politique. </p> <p> (<I>Ce qui suit n\'est pas encore implémenté, mais je voulais simplement vous informer de ce qui est à venir :</I>) Les données affichées dans le classement et le profil sont agrégées à partir des informations publiées sur OpenStreetMap.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-11-19 18:41:06,Always unglue the map while solving a quest,"[Label(name=""feedback required"")]",0,"If you want to solve a quest concerning an OSM way correctly (e.g. road surface, lit status, speed limit) you will have to make sure that the attribute in question doesn't change throughout the whole way. At least for road surfaces on agricultural ways such a change occurs surprisingly often, maybe it's due to the fact that many ways are originally drawn from aerial images. The only way to solve such a quest would be to split the way, which is currently not possible with StreetComplete (and possibly dangerous). At least the user should check the positions of the way's ends in order to determine if the quest is solvable at all.

However, if StreetComplete is in glue mode before tapping on a quest icon, it's currently impossible to do this thoroughly, because you're not able to move the map in order to find both ends. Zooming out is not always a real option for longer ways because the map gets sometimes very confusing and unclear, especially if there are many ways in a region.

Suggestion: Remember the glue state of the map before entering edit mode. Change the map state to ""unglued"" while in edit mode. Restore the previous mode after leaving edit mode. This way a user would be always able to check if an attribute is valid for the whole length of a way without destroying your general ""gule/unglue"" philosophy.

I have seen several shops indicating that they are closed during some months. Using the UI, I have to add the hours for the months where it is open, possibly several times.

For example, if it is closed during August and December, I will have to add the opening hours for every day once for January-July, and once for September-November.

When you select ""zone"", it adds the correct maxspeed:type element (e.g. ""maxspeed:type = DE:zone30"" for a zone with a maxspeed of 30 km/h in Germany).
Whenever you add only the speed without the zone element selected, the app adds ""maxspeed:type = sign"". This should not be happening since it could also have the maxspeed type ""DE:urban"" for 50km/h in a German town without any further restrictions.

Many maps (e.g. OsmAnd and OpenMTBMap/Velomap for Garmin devices) render paved ways differently which is very useful for road cyclists.

Ideas:

- If a surface quest is solved, the app could examine, if ""tracktype"" is set. If it's not, set it accordingly. If this attribute is already set, check if it's correct and in case it's not, correct it (maybe show a warning?)

- Discover these kinds of discrepancies and show them as normal ""surface"" quest as if the attributes aren't already set. If the quest has been solved by a user, proceed as stated above.

The best a SC user can do is to leave a note.

As this case occurs quite often, it would make life easier if there were a possibility to leave a pre-defined note (e.g. ""Way must be split in order to tag 'surface' correctly"") instead of having to type the same text over and over again.

In particular, seeing the housenumbers on buildings can be very useful when GPS is poor, and you don't know which building you are talking about for height quests, etc.

So, I have made some tweaks to the cinnabar styles and/or the way that StreetComplete is using them, complete with upstream PRs and issues to ensure that we don't end up maintaining too much of this ourselves.

So, a summary of the changes:

1) I have moved to the `label-11.yaml` theme of the cinnabar style that displays most labels and many POIs on the map (including bus stops!) (I have added an issue about this being better documented for cinnabar at https://github.com/tangrams/cinnabar-style/issues/51)

2) Although the above style shows address numbers, it doesn't show them until z20, which is ridiculous, so I have modified them to appear at zoom 17 and submitted a PR to get a similar change in the main style at https://github.com/tangrams/cinnabar-style/pull/52

3) I have made the new default building height more sensible (20 metres is too high, when surrounding heighted-buildings might only be 5-8 metres for 1-2 stories). Upstream PR: https://github.com/tangrams/cinnabar-style/pull/54

4) And finally, the new style shows traffic signals, but they had an ugly white border, so I removed the border from the icon sprite sheet. Upstream PR: https://github.com/tangrams/cinnabar-style/pull/53

_The more detailed informations you got, the more likely they will be become outdated over time._

**For example:**
A building will not change so often. It can be tear down or rebuild, but this is something that will (normaly) not change for decades.
But the shops in the building, or the opening hours of a shop, will most likely change over years or even more often.

With the right parameters (time) this problem of corse matches for nearly all kind of informations.

**The general Idea:**
I think it would be great to implement an easy way to verify and delete outdated informations.

**A concrete implementation:**
Would it be possible to show the opening hours of a shop for verification? For example: ""Are the given opening hours 'Mo-Fr 09:00-16:00' for 'Shopname' still valid?""
If the answer is no, then delete the opening hours.

**Problems:**
How to filter, which opening hours should be presented? It should be possible, to extract the last change date of the opening hours. If this date is older than a given period, show them for verification.
How to apply the answer ""Yes, opening hours still valid""? If someone already verified the opening hours, they shouldnt be presented to the next user for verification. I can imagine a lot of ways, how to do this, but dont know what whould be best practice to fit into OSM patterns.

For nodes with amenity=restaurant there should be a quest asking if the restaurant is kosher and/or halal. This question should only apply in countries with enough Jews/Muslims. For the kosher question only Israel, Gibraltar, United States and Canada have more than 1% Jews, for the halal question you can [look at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country).

Maybe it can also be added to supermarkets and convenience stores but I'm not sure how common is it.

It seems it is because `directionMarker` **is not null**, but `directionMarkerSize` **is null** in `onRotationChanged` in app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/tangram/MapFragment.java.

Rearranging the initialisation in `initMarkers` so that `directionMarkerSize` is set before `directionMarker` is should solve the problem, even if `onRotationChanged` is called _during_ `initMarkers`, which does seem to happen for me, at least some of the time.

My instinct is telling me to set up all of the markers in local variables first, then assign them to the class so that they are either fully initialised or null when listeners fire, but I haven't gone that far here, just yet.

I've run this a few times, and it hasn't crashed yet, which it would do before semi-often. I'll run this over the next few days to be sure, though."

All bus stop shelters of a route can be surveyed while sitting on the bus. For surveying the tactile paving, you have to go directly next to it, it's impossible surveying from the bus itself, so a survey is needed for each bus stop separately. So my suggestion is, that shelter quest should have higher priority and tactile paving should appear, when shelter is already filled in."
westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,Map rotates nervously in compass mode,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"Hi there,

first of all, congratulations to this brilliant idea to make some OSM editing more convenient, especially for people who do this rarely in their spare free time. Since I discovered your app a few weeks ago, I have used it on my bicycle on my way to work, for shopping or just for recreational purposes. My own neighbourhood gets more and more complete (at least concerning road surfaces and opening times).

Now for my issue:
v2.0 introduced the compass mode, which I was eagerly awaiting, but sadly it's quite unusable on my smartphone (BQ Aquaris M4.5, Android 5.1)! If I switch compass mode on, the map display rotates quite wildly, even if I ride a straight road with 20 km/h. It almost looks as if I rode my bike totally drunk... If I switch off compass mode (north is at the top), the circular sector pointing to the viewing direction jitters, which could also be a hint of GPS reacting too ""nervously"".

I haven't seen this behaviour with other apps and double-checked it today with OsmAnd - no problem there, the map doesn't rotate while cycling on a straight road.

I recorded a video clip, you will see immediately what's happening:
https://we.tl/54i6MjcVOi (6 MB)

(During this recording, 9 satellites were receivable, so it  shouldn't be a problem of poor GPS signal reception)

Is this a known problem? If it's not a bug in your app: Do you have an idea if it's fixable on my smartphone?

I can not see any housenumber and i think the buildings of this hospital are not numbered but have names (maybe this is common about hospitals, i do not know).
I think it is still ok for StreetComplete to ask for a housenumber when there is only a name.

But what i would say is a bug is the following:
If i click on ""Weitere Antworten""/""Further Answers"", there is the option ""Keine Nummer aber ein Hausname""/""No number but a housename"". This is the case, so i clicked on it. Then it lets me enter the housename. But i know that the building already has a name, so i do not want to enter a name again.
I'm not sure what i would expect to be the correct behaviour.
Maybe StreetComplete should not ask for housenumbers at hospital buildings that already have a name (Like it is the case with university buildings i guess).
Maybe StreetComplete should have another option when there is already a name to just tell it that the building has no housenumber and ignore this specific issue in the future.
But overwriting an existing name is not that good i would say.

E.g. which version will you release as a stable? 2.0 (so going backwards with the release numbers? -> that could break F-Droid) or 2.2 (skipping 2.1 as a stable?) or what?
Marking a version as a pre-release on GitHub is not enough (also not enough for F-Droid, which wrongly offers 2.0 and 2.1 as stable releases to F-Droid users).

I'd strongly suggest you to abide to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), i.e. here is an example of version numbers:
* 1.0 = stable version
* 2.0-alpha1 = Alpha release of v2.0
* 2.0-alpha2 = 2nd alpha release of v2.0
* 2.0-beta1 = Beta release of v2.0
* […]
* 2.0-rc1 = first release candidate of v2.0
* 2.0-rc2 = second release candidate of v2.0
* 2.0 = final stable release of of v2.0

So you see you can iterate with pre-release versions as you want and in the end release the final version. Of course, you do not need to use all these stages. You can also just release one beta version and directly release the final version afterwards. That's fine, but the point is: If you use a pre-release version, use a pre-release version number (respectively suffix)."

Not sure how doable this is, but I just noticed that when you go to a restaurant (for instance), Google Maps sometimes asks you questions about the restaurant, to crowdsource the info. I was wondering whether StreetComplete could do something similar (with an option to disable it for instance).

Typical use case is I don't always think about starting StreetComplete to look for quests nearby. But very often, I realize that I could have filled infos about a restaurant or a shop while I was there, and that it would have been super convenient to have a notification at this time (typically for shop schedule or restaurant menu). Maybe StreetComplete could have fetched the nearby quests in background and if I had stayed at some restaurant or shop for some time, it could notify me about such quests? Of course, it would be an anti-feature if StreetComplete was to ask me about ground type for every street I pass, there should be some limitations to given quests types.

What do you think?

### General
Affected key(s) (or tags) to be modified: [`playground`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:playground)
Question asked: **What elements are there on this playground?**

<!-- If the answer is not obvious, please append a short explanation to each item (or, if it is longer, below), explaining the reason. -->
### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see guidelines):
- [x] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose (finding different installations)
- [x] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one); there can't be ""nothing"" on a playground, so the user can always answer something
- [x] 🐿️ Easily answerable by everyone from the outside

There are many small playgrounds in parks, in residential areas (where you otherwise only have the boring lit, streetsurface and house quests :wink:) and so on and these small ones are more likely to miss the data what installations are there.

-->

### Ideas for implementation
<!-- If you do not have any, just delete this part. ;)  -->

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection:** Nodes and – if possible – small areas/relations or areas/relations where no other thing is inside them, tagged with `leisure=playground` (and, of course, without any object/installation already specified)

The reason for the specific condition for areas is just, that the objects on the playground can also be mapped . For nodes this is no problem, because nodes are well… nodes. They are only one point and thus you have to specify the installations on the playground in that node (if mapped correctly).
For areas, however, you either just include the small areas (max. 5m or so…), where you are sure no one can reasonably map installations as separate items, or, you check whether installations are associated with the `leisure=playground` relation and ignore them.

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you even have ideas, where to get this data from, you can of course also mention it! -->
**Metadata needed:** Maybe the most common values per country? (although I am not sure whether they vary that much…, maybe an international dataset might also be sufficient) Could be extracted/use the already-existent OSM data for that.

E.g. from taginfo:
![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11966684/30296611-0f377ae2-9745-11e7-915a-30deeb4cb77c.png)

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-09-11 22:11:48,Improve UI for entering shops times,[],0,"Hi,

I was wondering whether we could improve the UI layout for the ""shops times"" quest. The main issues I see are:

* Opening and closing times are not on the same page, but in different tabs, then requiring one extra click. However, I think there could be room for both of them to fit inside the same tab.
* The time ""wheel"" to select minutes display all possibilities, from 1 to 59. It's very rare that a shop closes at some hour 54 minutes for instance, they would rather open and close according to multiple of 15. Then, we could display only 0, 15, 30 and 45, so that the selection would be way faster in these cases. Sure, we should need another way to enter precise exact values, such as ""54"".

This would allow to enter opening and closing times way faster, and this quest has been one of the most time consuming I have tackled so far :)

Also, the UI can be misleading about the proper way to enter data. Say I am facing a shop with following schedules:

> Mon-Fri : 8am-12am, 2pm-6pm
> Sat : 8am-12am

I usually add in this order:
1. ""Mon-Fri"", ""8am-12am""
2. ""Mon-Fri"", ""2pm-6pm""
3. ""Sat"", ""8am-12am""
which gives me the same UI output as the one I am facing on the shop sign.

However, it seems that I could be more efficient and enter:
1. ""Mon-Sat"", ""8am-12am""
2. ""Mon-Fri"", ""2pm-6pm""

This would describe the same schedules, but the UI render them differently. Not sure if there is a reason behind that. Otherwise, I'll suggest collapsing the Saturday entry in my first example, to have the same render with both inputs.

Sorry for the long issue :/ Thanks a lot for all the work you are putting in StreetComplete, this is awesome! :)"

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,New Quest: GNIS Schools (US),"[Label(name=""new quest"")]",0,"### General
This quest is currently impossible because you can't delete things using SC. Still, if that ever becomes possible, this might be a nice one.

Question asked: **Does a school exist at this location?**

In the US community, we are currently developing a MapRoulette challenge for validating an old import of school locations in MapRoulette. You can find the challenge [here](http://maproulette.org/map/2774).

The instruction on MapRoulette is: 

> The highlighted feature represents a school location from the GNIS import. Please verify if a school exists at the location using available aerial imagery. If there is clearly no school building, delete the node. If there is a school, draw the building outline and copy the relevant tags over to the outline. If it is a large school complex, you can also map the entire school grounds and copy the relevant tags to that area, and map the school building within it just as building=school. Please also add other details like sports facilities, parking lots, service roads as you observe them.
> 
> Much more information on mapping schools is available on the OSM wiki.
> 
> As always: if you’re not sure, just skip the task.

StreetComplete could help by focusing on just deleting non-existing shools (which are many).

It seems to break some quests that are at this moment purely hypothetical in StreetComplete, but I had them in my fork.

For example displaying text of fixme tag (or other tags) as the quest question no longer appears to be possible. Real affected code includes https://github.com/matkoniecz/StreetComplete/blob/fork/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/show_fixme/ShowFixmeForm.java#L29 (fixme quest) or https://github.com/matkoniecz/StreetComplete/blob/fork/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/road_surface/showInvalidSurfaceForm.java#L23 (displaying unexpected surface values).

Is there some way now to achieve this effect? Or is it necessary for me to either remove this type of quest or make fork deeper and include my own code to handle quests requiring freeform tag title?"

The point is, that it's a good thing for disabled, especially blind people, to now, if the traffic light is button_operated, has a sound, etc. But these informations are very rare on OSM, because you don't notice them as a normal person.

Necessary Tags on the Node:
_highway=crossing_ + _crossing=traffic_signals_
Sould also work for:
_highway=traffic_signals_ + _crossing=traffic_signals_

Looking at makeNoteClosed in app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/data/osmnotes/OsmNotesDownload.java, it looks like If I have a comment on a note (which I guess includes the creation comment), it won't show up.

I understand this is an issue so that quests I left notes on don't show back up in StreetComplete, this happens for notes I create on the website and from within JOSM too.

In thinking through the scenarios, I think the following could happen:

1. Anyone (_including myself_) creates a note externally to StreetComplete: **these should show up**
2. Anyone (_including myself_) creates a note, and I answer it in StreetComplete: **these shouldn't show up**
3. A note is created by myself (and maybe anyone else?) using StreetComplete can't say feature: **these shouldn't show up**.
4. A note that I have answered in StreetComplete has another comment added since answering in StreetComplete: **unsure what should happen**?

It seems to me a more sensible logic should be 'Was the last comment on the note created by StreetComplete (and then maybe was it also from the current user)?' which could be checked by looking for the string 'StreetComplete'.

Alternatively, is it possible to add metadata to OSM Notes to make this more robust? I couldn't find a clear indication on the OSM API page which doesn't seem to actually outline the notes data format."

This rule is, however, not always strictly enforced, as these quests may need looking/going inside a building:
* wheelchair quest (I admit, I also sometimes did not do this and just looked whether the entry is okay…) https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/26

* internet access? https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/99
* takeaway? https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/104 (here, however, maybe you would even have to ask, as no sign is even inside the building)

* worship service times? (here was some discussion too) https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/232

(Note this list should not imply all these quests should be disabled by default or restricted with a requirement below.)

Here are some…

# ways to handle them

## disable them by default
As @Etua proposed in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/554#issuecomment-325229126:
> However as the number of suggestions of quests that require entering some place (or specifically building) will increase (even already implemented wheelchair access may be considered as one) we may think of including them together with #35. Ideally all such tasks wouldn't be shown by default, but a possibility to turn them on as a group or only some of them depending on a user's decision would be offered.

Depends on https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/35

I (@rugk) agreed in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/553#issuecomment-325345056:
> The best thing would be if #35 is solved and then such quests could be added as ""disabled by default"".

## fork?
@CloCkWeRX suggested in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/553#issuecomment-325238302:
> I'd be really keen to explore a gentle fork of StreetComplete focused on ""I'm sitting down/standing around in line inside of a business, what can I answer"" for things like this, #104 #99 etc.
> You could even call it... ""EatComplete"" :P

I (@rugk) opposed in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/553#issuecomment-325345056:
> IMHO a fork would not be nice, (don't wanna use two apps…) better improve this app.

## use location detection
@ServusWorld suggested in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/553#issuecomment-325304387:
> Maybe such POI-specific quests shouldn't be shown on the map always, but only if you are very near (distance < 15m) to it so that it can be assumed you are inside.

Of course, ideas can be combined. 

# A note about users and gamification

A problem coming with the (maybe in the future even increased) gamification is that users may **answer quests without actually seriously checking what the quests asks for** and thus enter unreliable data.
When they cannot enter a building but see the quest they may be tempted to do that. (This effect is, however, of course also possible without gamification, i.e. just because the user wants to solve as many quests as possible or clear the map or so…)

I see, however, a difference between the **vegan/vegtarian quest** and **wheelchair quest** here e.g. As I said, I incorrectly mapped the wheelchair quest some times or at least, did not check whether the inner part of the building is also accessible. That may have to do with the thing, that the quest talks about whether the building is *access*ible, i.e. whether you can enter there. (Note the German translation literally translates this as ""zugänglich"".) So such things may happen in a **good faith**.

I however doubt that many users would wrongly answer the vegan/vegetarian quest when they cannot see it from the outside, as here they cannot just guess or so… It is very obvious that both things can be possible and users have no clue when there is no sign with the menu or so…
That's why they'd have to select one option arbitrarily, whcih would be very clear to users that it is vandalism. So here they would have to act in **bad faith**.

I am just telling this, because that may be a difference for these quests and whether they might be shown/disabled/off-by-default or how any other restriction mechanism may be applied."

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-08-28 18:38:32,"How can we better propose ""new quest types""?",[],0,"Starting a discussion about the reoccurring problems of how quests can be proposed.

### The problem
* Getting new quest suggestion [is time-consuming](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/525#issuecomment-325120503)
* We cannot stop people from proposing quests, also because this is a very legitimate thing for a FLOSS project, where the main thing are these quests
* Often people do not think about all aspects/requirements involved when creating quests
* Often it is hard to decide and needs some discussion (see ""needs time"")
* This problem won't go away with more and more app users.
* It would be best if more people would develop these quests and sent PRs as development time is needed, not ideas for quests.

### What we have…
* Only [the wiki](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/wiki/Adding-new-Quests-to-StreetComplete), which I think is more about developing/implementing a quest. It has, however, also some requirements listed.
* And some general information about the aim of the project in the Readme. (That's good, but specific requirements are still unclear to issue creators)

Generally both things require the issue creator to read a lot of text. We are on the internet, however! So we need…

### What we need…
* A short and precise way
* Easy UI, usable by everyone (just as the wonderful UX StreetComplete has, this solution has to be easy, too)
* Getting proposals into a common, well-structured form
* Requiring some thought from the user
* Clearly documenting the requirements

### The solution(?)
* [separate bug tracker](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/546#issuecomment-325171557)/repo?
* in-app mechanism or own website or third-party mechanism
* staying on GitHub, but making it easier for people to suggest quests properly
* close all proposals for quests immediately

### How?
* separate -> easy (move StreetComplete to organisation, new ""issue-only"" repo), advantage unclear (Quests are still there, may still be wrong)
* extra website* -> hard (needs development), advantage depends (on how it is done)
* third-party service* -> medium (needs thought/selection. UserVoice, maybe? Or some survey portal, where you can go through the requirements one by one? Or Discourse, with it's approach to ""let the community manage themselves""?), advantage depends (e.g. is uservoice really better than GitHub?)
* stay on GitHub -> Ticklist with short description for quests, which users proposing quests **have to** go through -> easy (just an issue template with ticklist similar to [this one](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/549#issue-253160980)), advantage depends (how effective is that template?)
* close proposals -> rude, not in the faith of FLOSS, destroys community, frightens potential contributors, i.e. no solution; advantage: nothing

\* extra advantage: users do not have to be on GitHub for proposing quests

Of course, I am biased. (I would suggest the ticklist as an issue template, and also include a template part for letting the user think about the UI)
Of course the proposals could be combined. E.g. the issue template with the ticklist can be in a new repo, specialized for that."

More over the zoom level is reset every time I enter the application if I'm in the follow me mode, which additionally forces me to click on the compass to get rid of it.

Ideal fix for me would be:
1. Remember the zoom level in follow me mode, between application restarts (e.g. after disabling and enabling the screen)
2. Allow moving the view in this mode, by doing a switch to a ""free"" mode

* Is it [analogue or digital](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:display)? (sundial and ""unorthodox"" are extreme, rare cases)
* Does it show the current date? [date:yes/no](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:date)
* (maybe) Does it have a thermometer? (barometer and hygrometer would be possible too, but IMHO are rare)
* How is it mounted? [support=*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:support)
* How many [faces](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:faces) does it have? 
* (maybe) How far is it [visible](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:visibility)? Good thing here is, we do not have to use meters (that would be hard to decide), but can just use [the values](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dclock#Visibility) ""house"" (<= 5m), ""street"" (<=20m) and ""area"" (> 20m).

As these are quite a lot values, I think, it would make sense to not only split it into two quests or so, but rather simplify the ones we can group together. I mean we can just ask for the ""type of the clock"" and then provide typical clocks using an image selection as usual.

The [3 wiki examples](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dclock#Examples) are already good. They are:
* 4-faced analog clock on a pole
* wall-mounted analog clock visible from two sites
* billboard digital clock

Additionally, I'd say we need:
* wall-mounted analog clock only visible from one site

Maybe we can also group the clocks to analog and digital versions, as the wall-mounted and maybe also the billboard clocks can both be digital or analog.


A further quest could ask for all digital clocks whether they have a thermometer and/or date display (I doubt analog clocks can display the date).

And yet another quest could ask about the visibility.
So all in all we could cover all these tags above with 3 quests, where only 2 quests are shown for analog clocks.

To avoid this problem, you could set up a multi-level question:
1.: Is there an explicit sign for the maxspeed on this road or ist this road part of an explicit maxspeed-zone?
If answered with yes: Use the same overlay to ask for the maxspeed that you use right now

2.: Is the road in a urban or a rural zone? (You can also ask for other zones like the ""Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich"" in Germany)(maybe it's better to ask this question via pictures)

As always the implementation is great, thumbs up to @ENT8R, but it would be greater with that 🏝. :wink: 
Especially as here, in Germany and Austria these are not that uncommon.

My suggestion would be to just add a small message box below the three images, which says:
> [ ] This crossing has a traffic isle in the middle.

As that ""property"" can, of course, apply to all these three images, that is reasonable, IMHO. And it does not take much vertical space away…
Downside: You have no image there. But if you want to be sure, maybe display the image (similar to how you show a popup for livingstreet or so) when the user first clicks on taht checkbox and let him/her confirm the decision. Afterwards, this is hopefully not necessary anymore as they ""learned"" what a traffic island is. (and that it is not :desert_island: :wink:)

Alternatively, try to get it into ""Other answers"" somehow? (Don't know how yet, however, because you also need the ""initial"" answer to the main quest.)

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-10-13 21:17:15,Misuse of source:maxspeed for edits in UK,"[Label(name=""feedback required"")]",0,"Some years ago a long discussion on talk-gb agreed that information of about the type of speed limit would be added in a tag maxspeed:type and source:maxspeed would be used, as expected, for information about how the maxspeed was obtained (survey, aerial imagery etc). Therefore [adding ](http://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/51166065)source:maxspeed tags with values like GB:rural is strongly deprecated. I realise that usage may be different elsewhere, but I think it is important that mapping tools respect community consensus.

The UK consensus was to always add a numeric value in maxspeed, use maxspeed:type to clarify whether the value was absolute (explicitly signed as such) or a national speed limit (denoted by the black bend on white sign). How the maxspeed information was obtained (survey, aerial etc) belongs in the source:maxspeed tag.
Adding a source:maxspeed tag alone is very poor practice and almost certainly will not be recognised by any data consumers.

Additionally the valid values for [maxspeed:type](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org.uk/keys/maxspeed:type) in the UK are:

- GB:nsl_dual (i.e., 70 mph)
- GB:nsl_single (i.e., 60 mph)
- GB:motorway
- GB:national (also used but deprecated because of the differences between dual & single carriageways.

There is no 'rural' speedlimit tag in the UK, and limited need to map generic urban speedlimits. Urban speed limits are more-or-less universally signed. Historically, some where not and places with streetlights did default to the national urban limit (so GB:urban is valid, but not very useful).

There is a [residual tail](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org.uk/keys/source%3Amaxspeed) of source:maxspeed tags with type values but these date back to before the discussion alluded to as above."

* For issue creators suggesting new quests/ideas, to see whether a quest is already implemented or there is a similar quest (ehm… https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/394 🙄)
* For developers/contributors, to check whether there is a similar quest (code) they can reuse.
* For users as ""advertisement"". ""See how much quests you can answer here!"" (potentially in conjunction with ""And you can contribute your own ones!""). You could include it in app description, etc.
* For the curious, [who don't know what is ""hidden"" behind these icons](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/res/quest_icons.svg), but like to know…
* For OSM mappers, so they can see what things this app can modify/comment, etc.

And for various other user questions:
* For ""Ehh, I saw an icon there once, but I do not remember what type of quest this is?""
* For ""Hmm, can I also use this quest to answer XY?""
* For ""I only see quests about street? Does this mean **Street**Complete is only about streets?""

### Concrete suggestion

I image a table or a similar format, which should contain the following elements (in the following or a similar order, ordered by importance):
1. Quest icon.
2. Quest name (short)
3. Quest question
4. What the quest means, if it is not clear OR an example OR a screenshot (may take too much space, however, but on the other hand also shows how the user input/selection is done)
5. Link to code where it is implemented, and – if it applies – link to resource files (YAML) used
6. Link to issue/discussion/PR, if there is one
7. (optional) link to example changeset or similar explanation/depiction of what may/is changed by this quest
8. (optional) since when (version number and/or date) the quest is included

I tried to include all the interests from the ""user stories"" above. Anyway, before anyone (including me) starts to make this table, let's first finish this discussion in this issue about **what** to include and in **which order**.

I am not entirely sure how to do this better, but you should certainly be able to improve this for your users a bit by

- using less screen estate for the map, maybe making the map tile quite small actually, especially since the question ""what road surface does $Roadname have here"" is specifically asked.
- making it optional whether this question is displayed at all.
- using smaller buttons for surface types, maybe allowing for long-presses to get more information, or overlaying text. The button size could be configurable, and the first row could be e.g. hard surfaces, the second row gravel surfaces, etc.
- presenting the most common responses in a row by itself at the top
- letting the user define shortcuts or favourite answers etc.

In general, I'd appreciate (and would contribute a whole lot more) if it was as simple as hitting on a surface type quest and then having to touch the screen only one more time before confirmation."

In Montrouge, some bus stops are tagged as a node next to a way with the attributes `highway=bus_stop` and `public_transport=stop_position`. When the shelter information is not indicated, apparently StreetComplete does not ask for it, because such nodes are not selected here: https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/bus_stop_shelter/AddBusStopShelter.java#L23. I'm not sure why such nodes are excluded -- is the idea that the shelter should not be added on a bus stop tagged as one node on a way? In this case, maybe the question could be asked in the case when the nodes are not part of a way?

When answering a speed limit quest with ""there is no sign"" and then saying that the road is ""in a town"", StreetComplete seems to create a ""source:maxspeed"" attribute on the way containing (in France) ""FR:urban"", but no ""maxspeed"" entry. This looks wrong according to the description of ""source:maxspeed"" on the OSM wiki (see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:source:maxspeed) and triggers a warning in JOSM when editing the region.

I think StreetComplete should also create a ""maxspeed"" attribute containing the value indicated in the OSM wiki for the value of ""source:maxspeed"" that it creates.

westnordost/StreetComplete,open,,New quest: contact information for shops (hairdresser & doctors),[],0,"Reviewing somehow, but not a dupe (I would not open a new issue for that…)

There you said:
> Perhaps in conjunction with general contact data (phone number, website etc), but also that probably not.

Yeah, why not do it in this way.

IMHO/AFAIK/Here in Germany I think the most common contact information is a phone number. Maybe not for restaurants, but at least most shops, hairdresser and doctors have it… (list could be expanded, or made country-specific)
Often they are written on the door/outside of the building.

So:
overpass query: all these amenities/buildings without [phone](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:phone)/`contact:phone` tag
input: primarily focus on phone number, but also allow (maybe after swiping/moving the box up) to input other [contact information](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:contact) such as fax, website and email. Possibly also social media…

However when talking about contact information also the address belongs to it. Not sure how we want to handle this. Maybe a new quest or do not ask that at all? I mean the house number quest only tags houses. A shop could have:  addr:street=*, addr:housenumber=* and addr:postcode=*. But as addr:housenumber=* and addr:postcode=*. are often [redundant](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses#How_to_map_addresses), only asking for `addr:housenumber` (in that quest) could be okay…"

As for Germany (Gymnasium, Mittelschule, Oberschule, etc.) or New Zealand, where there are different kinds of schools in the same education level, the `isced:field=*` could be used. I think that's what this type of field is to be used for…

Of course, this could also be used for detecting wrong tags, i.e. there could be an entry ""this is a different educational building"" and offer to retag it as a different building. (Or, of course, ""this is no educational building"".)"

Low (or none) non-answerable quests and clear answers hopefully everybody understands. Maybe we need a country-specific list as in the sports quest.

One problem is, the [scientific names](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:species) should be saved.

I have started to read about different Quality Assurance tools for OSM, here:

Whilst reading, I noticed that one common problem seems to be one way streets that don't go anywhere, meaning they are 'dead ends'. I believe these should be tagged as two way streets. Could this be helped with a quest?

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-08-09 15:57:24,Type of Crossing,[],0,"Like mentioned in issue #397, this PR adds a quest which will allow the user to set the type of a crossing.
This is my first PR, so I have a few questions:

1. Is the importance (lowest) of the quest right?
2. I used the quest icon ""pedestrian_crossing"" but this is used by another question too... So do we need a new icon for this quest?
3. I wanted to import some images for each answer but I didn't know how to do this... So I used a hydrant as a placeholder.

But the images I found so far are:

- [Traffic lights](http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/Green-Traffic-Lights-Little-Green-Man-Go-819851)
- [Uncontrolled crossing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AZebra_crossing.jpg)

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-08-09 15:13:26,Use around to find out probably lit ways,[],0,"Two ideas that are based on `around`:

1.
If there is a road with `lit=yes`, then it highly probable that roads `around` it might have it also. Overpass query that does this:

way(around:100)[""highway""~""primary|secondary|tertiary|unclassified|residential|living_street|service|pedestrian""]({{bbox}});

This would allow to extend the lightning for roads that don't have sidewalks, but are in enough developed parts that have lights at streets.

2. If there is a separate footway/cycleway near given road, it gives high probability that there the road is lit.

1. When clicking on the surface icon a popup message appears and asks for a type to submit. But this message is only visible halfway so the next step is always to pull up the message box.
![screen01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5578303/27996937-91647806-64ed-11e7-88a2-537fc3f2c4f8.png)
Wouldn't it be easier, if the message would pop up completely? It least after clicking on ""Paved"" the complete collection should present itself without any further user interaction needed, I guess?
![screen02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5578303/27996944-94231606-64ed-11e7-9ae9-76fb8a257cc9.png)

2. That's say I'm in a neighborhood where a lot of surface tags are missing. Usually all this streets are of the same type (Asphalt for example) but I have to redo all this steps for each road/segment: clicking on the icon, selecting Paved, pull up, selecting Asphalt...)
Maybe a small ""same as last time"" button would be helpful? So after clicking on the surface icon I could still select between the surface types but on top of the list would be a shortcut with my last selection?"

Ending up in paths with bad visibility is a problem when using routing in e.g. Osmand, why I think not only relations should be included.

Adjective ""accessible"" in Russian is also tricky like this: ""доступен"" and ""доступна"". So there's no way to translate this phrase so that it would always work correctly in those languages.

To be fair, I don't know if Spanish would be fine for now, because ""parada"", ""entrada"" and ""ubicación"" (if that's what the translators chose, I can't see it) are all feminine, but there's also no way to guarantee that all location types would be like that in the future.

A problem could be that more than one fruit/crop is produced, so first of all selecting multiple values must be necessary. Apart from that, maybe you need to ask this question multiple times (winter, summer, spring, etc.) to find out, what is always produced. Don't know how to do this though…"

One potential issue is that people using the development branch may experience crashes if they try to enter a bus stop quest that was downloaded using the last revision, with this revision.  Clearing the quest cache and re-downloading quests will resolve this.  It does not affect the production version as this quest has never gone live in that version.

People are coming up with some really good ideas for new Quests. This has made me wonder the best way to analyse what data is missing from OSM, and the creating quests. This is also something that interests me.

1. Does a guide/ how-to exist, that explains how missing data can be identified?

2. Can this data be analysed by non-programmers?

3. Does the guide suggest that people can volunteer to study the data, and suggest new Quests?

4. Once a new quest has been identified, it can be raised as an issue, here, for others to comment on/ refine, prior to being considered for addition to StreetComplete.

Any thoughts? I'm keen to see wide usage of this tool, to improve data.

Thanks,

Daher meine Frage / Anmerkung ob es möglich wäre, bei einem Öffnungszeiteneintrag automatisch auch den ""opening_hours:lastcheck"" Stempel mit dem aktuellen Datum zu setzen.

Please add a Question to set if it is a water well, fontain, waterpoint, watering_place and if it is drink water or not.
the rule in Switzerland on public ground is that, if there is no  ""Kein Trinkwasser"" (no drink water) sign you could drink it. Outside on non Public ground it depend on the owner. Answers should be yes, no, unknown.
Most but not all drinking water well on public ground in Switzerland contain a year of building.

- user fetches quests, including quest for object with a given id (lets say that it is building with way id 190)
- quests stay in cache (with longer time it is more likely, but it is always possible)
- somebody else edits object and as result way with id 190 is now describing lake (for example somebody split/moved road, or somebody deleted object and id was reused in object created later[1])
- quest is solved
- StreetComplete makes edit that makes no sense whatsoever

[1] see https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1/history for example of node that was recreated with completely different meaning and location

It is going to be quite rare but it is not impossible (I already encountered this situation, as result of editing with StreetComplete and Vespucci at the same location with badly mapped road - as I was aware what is happening I avoided last part and no ridiculous edit occurred). But given that many people use this editor this kind of problematic edits will sooner or later occur.

Maybe StreetComplete should remember location of quest and at least in cases of major movements do not apply edit? Remembering exact geometry is not ideal, as minor changes are OK.

It is open question whatever effort necessary to fix that is worth avoiding this possibility of problems."

There are two solutions I would propose.

It makes sense to request this information right in the housenumber quest, because there is not other point in time where it makes sense to ask for a housename (as most houses have no names).

I think the best way to implement this would be to offer an option in the ""Other answers..."" menu called ""It has a housename"". On clicking it, the form transforms into an input where one can specify both a housenumber and a name. In this form, the user can leave the house number empty (he usually may not).

Another option would be to provide an option for all quests to submit the form but _also_ leave a note (i.e. ""these are the opening hours BUT the name changed to xyz"". This is a feature that goes around in my mind some time already but I haven't had an idea yet how to squeeze this it into the UI and if it is worth over simply leaving a note.

Apropos simply leaving a note, I am going back and forth on the idea of implementing this at all, since the user can simply leave a note in the rare case that a house has a name. Anyway, this has no high priority for me, just wanted to write it down. Ideas, opinions and PRs are welcome."

I propose to add similar quests, asked for surface=paved and surface=unpaved and asking to make these data more detailed - it will allow both to make existing data more detailed and stop discouraging answering general answer.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-06-02 22:29:00,Display housenumbers and bus stops on basemap,[],0,"This pull request modifies the cinnabar basemap style to display house numbers, building names and bus stops on the base map. Resolves issue #162.

Since there are quests to add house numbers and details about bus stops, it seems reasonable to me that these details should be visible on the base map.  Additionally, it may make orientation easier.  However, it does involve modifying the default cinnabar style, which may make updating to new upstream releases, while maintaining these changes, more difficult.

There are a couple of possible issues with these changes:
1. A possible bug in tangram-es prevents '\n' being interpreted as a line break (it works in Tangram Play on the web, but not in the app), so I've opted to display building name in preference to house number in cases where both of these exist.  This is an assumption on my part that building name tends to be more important than building number.
2. These items are only displayed from z18 onwards.  This may or may not be an appropriate zoom level to begin displaying at.
3. Quests will prevent the items from being displayed. For example, the quest marker for a bus stop quest will be displayed, but the bus stop symbol at that particular location won't.  This might not be a bad thing, however.
4. There will be a delay between submitting quest answers (for house numbers, at least) and the information being visible on the basemap due to mapzen not immediately updating their tiles.

A more accurate ""jump"" is fine, and doesn't give the impression of the GPS being accurate when it clearly is not. Its quite confusing to be standing still and have the GPS do little smooth sloshes. Having it perform discrete jumps is easier to tell how accurate the GPS actually is being (i realise there is the circle, but it can't show biasses very well. only statistical error.), without having to wait a few minutes to figure it out from the slow wobbles.

While using StreetComplete in Oslo I noticed that almost all buildings have the ""What is the house number of this building"" quest.

According to the [OpenStreetMap wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses#Norway) addresses in Norway are not tied to the building outline, but instead are a separate feature.
Furthermore Norwegian addresses are automatically added from a government data source so almost all buildings are already correctly numbered.

In situation where doing one quests makes further one possible following situation is possible:

- mapper goes along street doing ""add building:levels and roof:levels"" quest
- later automatic download kicks in and as result ""add roof type"" quests are created (at least for ones with roof:levels>0)
- so mapper must go along the same street collecting information again

As new quests appear this may be more common - for example once planned ""replace building=yes by more precise data"" group of building=yes would be even more irritating: as first steep improve building values, and then go through everything twice like described above.

That's very important and can be a good argument to find contributors.
The aim could be to get it working as in [HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/), where you have many, many contributors adding XML files.

So what could be covered?
* Simple yes/no questions. (https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/107, e.g.)
* A generic image.
* Simple questions with text input connected to a tag.

How?
Your decision: JSON, XML, …
The only thing I'd suggest is to put one new quest type into a new file, so we won't have crazy big files, disputes how to sort/order entries or maybe even merge conflicts.

Also:
* A guide or a small tool making it even easier to create a quest.
* Example quests. (or just in the guide if it is easy)
* A very clear explanation what quests are wanted and what not. And maybe suggest to open an issue before, so one can check whether it is wanted first."
westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-05-07 21:29:26,Encourage users to come back,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]",0,"I admit this is going to be a controversial approach and a bit like an anti-pattern for some users, so make it optional in any case.

### So what?
I think the app could regularly show a notification to encourage users to use the app again, if it has not been used for some time (a week, maybe?).

### Why?
* Users may forget that they have the app installed.
* Users may be lazy not opening the app.
* User may not think about the app when there is actually a good place to map where they are.
* Users may not notice they have not used the app for a while.
* User may have tried out the app once (maybe even liked it), but are not the types of people constantly opening all apps and doing that again
* nowadays, user often have many apps, so this app can get lost in the shuffle
* If they really do not want to use the app anymore (which is a synonym to contribute to OSM here), they'll uninstall it anyway, so by installing the app they already confirm their interest in this.
If it is optional (but opt-out IMHO) they can also just disable it if they think the app patronizes them. However, as explained, the user is actually interesting in doing the thing the app encourages the user.

### How?
Of course we should keep the notifications to a minimum and not scare them away saying ""this app annoys me, I uninstalled it."". That's why:
* it must not be shown when the user already actively uses the app
* it could maybe already do a background scan for quests and pick out a nice one near the user making it interesting to solve the quest
* it should be very clear about why it is notifying the user, e.g. say: ""Hey, you have not used StreetComplete for XY days, but I have an interesting quest (about XY/named/…) here for you. Do you want to solve it?""
* or it somehow uses the stars (""Only XY starts to get to 1000!""), although this may be criticised as too much gamification

## Background
This can of course also be seen as a part of the gamification, however, of course, this is a technique many nasty (game) apps (or so) employ too - to quite some success. We, however, here have legitimate reasons (helping keeping OSM contributions).
The app may already be a good thing to attract new OSM contributors and I think this is also somehow the aim of @westnordost, that's why I've also proposed https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/178, but the further steps are:
* keeping them (this issue)
* getting them to get more encouraged with OSM in general (ideas in https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/178#issuecomment-299734982)

I don't know if this app could have such a ""problem"" with many users not actively using it – we would need statistics for it, which we don't have (or maybe we have with install count or so?), but this idea won't hurt if implemented responsibly."

Graphically, it could be done like the roof shape quest, having [several sport symbols](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sports_pictograms) and user can choose one.

It is requesting nodes having `public_transport=platform` tag without `shelter=*` and `informal=*`. According to user input, it edits data this way:
- Informal: adds `informal=yes` tag
- Pole: adds `shelter=no`
- Shelter: adds `shelter=yes`

Why this quest ?
- It is simple for users to participate: 3 well-separated cases easily identifiable
- There are a lot of objects to qualify: just for France, it is more than 17000 objects
- Created data is useful for several uses cases : 3D rendering, safety around bus stop, urban planning...

I'm aware this is not directly a streetcomplete issue, but since this tool seems very useful and efficient I would very much like to use it on my replicant android device.
Since replicant does not support openGL ES because of the lack of open source drivers, any software that requires it crash on replicant devices.
It seems that Tangram uses openGL ES to display maps which makes your tool unusable on replicant devices.

Would it be possible to think of another library to handle maps in future versions, or to provide an non openGL way to display maps ?

For an individual quest, it could be useful to add a link into the UI pointing at the relevant openstreetmap wiki page.

   public String getHelpLink() {
      return ""https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway"";
   }
   // ...

Alternatively, pointing to a specific quest set of documentation (similar to what is done with some HOT tasks) would also be useful.

https://github.com/hotosm/osm-tasking-manager2/issues/979 talks about a similar usability need.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-04-06 21:40:29,Refactoring: Split out quests (queries) and common quest UI forms,[],0,"A lot of quests will likely fall into a number of different ways to answer them:
 * String input (single answer)
 * Integer input  (single answer)
 * Picture selection  (single answer)

with others remaining more complex and deserving dedicated UI.

For example:
https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/road_name/AddRoadName.java

and
https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/quests/place_name/AddPlaceName.java

both have similar string input results, lookups, etc.

Once you have 3-4 of a particular kind, it would be good to refactor those to a ""String question input"" or similar component; *and pull the question text, overpass query, and other UI labels out to a JSON or YAML file*.

By splitting up the quest and the UI, it'd be a lot easier for people to go from quest template (#86) to pull request.

I'm not suggesting make *everything* like this, but for common answer types it could rapidly expand the number of askable questions.

It may introduce difficulty with i18n, and there's a risk of inner platform effect kicking in; but done carefully it could be useful.

Psuedocode 'name' quest:

```
{
  ""title"": ""Restaurant missing name"",
  ""title:en"" ""Restaurant missing name"",
  ""question"": ""What is the local language name for this restaurant?"",
  ""question:en"": ""What is the local language name for this restaurant?"",
  ""quest.type"": ""string.single_answer"",
  ""answer.quests.name.noname"": true,
  ""answer.quests.canttell"": true,
  ""answer.quests.add_note"": true,
  ""answer.osm_tag"": ""name"",
  ""overpass.query"": ""(amenity = restaurant) and !name and noname != yes"",
  ""commit_message:en"": ""Added name to Restaurant""
}
```

and the quest handling code would start to look like
```
# Load all quests:
Dir(""./quests/string/single_answer/*.json).each do |file|
  quests << new StringSingleAnswerQuest(JSON.parse(file))
end

public class StringSingleAnswerQuest extends OverpassQuestType {
   public StringSingleAnswerQuest(JSON configuration) {

     this.setOpenstreetmapTag(configuration.openstreetmapTag);
     this.setTagFilter(configuration.overpassQuery);
   }

   @Override public Integer applyAnswerTo(Bundle answer, StringMapChangesBuilder changes) {
      String inputAnswer = answer.getString(StringSingleAnswerForm.ANSWER);
      if(inputAnswer != null) changes.add(this.getOpenstreetmapTag(), inputAnswer);
      return this.getCommitMessage();
   }
}

```
# Quest suggestions/request are really helpful to improve StreetComplete and
# know what our users want to tag...
#
### Question
# Every quest should be formulated as a question that is easy to understand. 
# Example: Is this road lit?

### Answers
# List all reasonable answers. If possible use OSM keys and link to the OSM wiki.
# Example:
#  * yes
#  * no
#  * lit_by_gaslight
# [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lit) 

### UI (optional)
# Describe how you imagine the UI to look. You can also include mockups as images. 
# Example:
#  Every answer has a little image above its text:
# * yes: a road with glowing lamp posts
# * no: a road with a read X next to it
# * lit_by_gaslight: a gas lamp
# ![](image.png)

### Quest scope (optional)
# If the quest would affect a huge number of object it can make sense to limit its scope to certain features or types. 
# Example: 
# Only offer this quest for bigger roads or roads that are paved.

It would be nice to split the naming quests into really missing names and sort-of-slip-road pedantry, so that I could disable the latter.  Unfortunately I don't have a great idea for how to separate this programmatically.   I would suggest ways that are < 20m, with each end connected to a named way, and those ways connected to each other with total distance < 3x the unnamed one."
westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2018-01-17 13:45:58,Improved user guidance through surface quest,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"As a first time user of StreetComplete I found the road surface quest to be a bit hard to understand. I think the quest flow can benefit from a few interaction improvements to guide the user through the flow:

1. After having tapped on the first surface option (""Paved (generic)"") the screen should switch to the full screen surface selector view to clarify that the next step is to pick the right subcategory (or just confirm the changes via ""OK"" at the end of the form). Currently user still needs to scroll down to open the full selector screen
2. After a top surface category (Paved / Unpaved / Ground) has been selected the other categories should be visually tuned out. I suggest applying a black and white filter and decreasing the opacity.
3. After the top surface category has been selected a call to action text should be added to clarify that as a next step the user should pick the subcategory. E.g. ""...now select the most fitting subcategory:"" 
4. After the subcategory has been selected there should be some hint that to complete the quest the user needs to scroll down and hit ""OK"". I would suggest that the form should scroll all the way down to show the ""OK"" button.

To be more specific here: consider the case of ferries. Ferries are tagged `route=ferry` and a `duration` tag describes how long the route takes. Without a `duration` tag you can only guess the duration.

The ferry tag is rare and the duration tags adds high value - a marker for a missing ferry duration tag should probably be prioritized among many opening hour, building level and roof shape markers.

here's a screen shot of my Android phone with German settings and it doesn't seem to render the ""ß"". It's supposed to be ""Neue Blumenstraße"" in Berlin. It shows up correctly in the OSM database (http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/190863137).

I didn't check but maybe there's the same problem for umlauts?

I opened up streetcomplete with WiFi on downloaded the map and quests.  I think I closed streetcomplete turned WiFi off then opened up Streetcomplete again.  I could see and complete the quests but since it had WiFi off it couldn't update the OSM database directly.

It gave an error message saying see log.  

The edits were held correctly and when WiFi mas enabled a batch was sent up correctly and entered OSM correctly.  So it all functioned as it should except the error message when it couldn't send the edits because it was off line.

For a new user this can be confusing.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2017-03-26 21:15:49,easier opening hours with half hours,[],0,setting an opening hour like 7:30 - 12:30 is tedious because you have to scroll through each of the 30 minutes. Because most of the times should be either *:00 oder *:30 they should be easier to choose. Or is that a operating system component? Because there is a lot of free space on the time choosing page there might be even other possibilities to choose the hours and minutes than the scrolling menu.

westnordost/StreetComplete,closed,2016-12-28 15:58:34,app asks for permission to upload GPS traces,[],0,"After completing a quest, I tried to upload it.   It sent me to osm OAuth which is fine, but it asked for not only permission to read profile, upload changesets, and change notes, but also to upload traces.   StreetComplete's documentation does not talk about recording GPS traces, and certainly it does not talk about uploading them.   Permissions should only be requested for things that are reasonably connected with the described functionality.

In addition, if one unchecks ""upload GPS traces"", the authorization is considered to fail, because not all requested permission were granted.   This is really a separate bug - even if there were a documented trace/upload function, it should be possible to do quests without authorizing upload.   I am happy to open a separate issue for that, but for now it doesn't seem useful."
