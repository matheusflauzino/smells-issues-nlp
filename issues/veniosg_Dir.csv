veniosg/Dir,closed,2017-08-07 13:29:32,Modifying navigation drawer,[],0,"Hey George,

I had some suggestions regarding nav. drawer-

>Increasing height of cover (background image) in navigation drawer

I think (pretty personal opinion), maybe the navigation drawer would look even better if the cover image for `Bookmark` text was a bit more in height, the way it is in Google apps. I think it's more cozy that way.

>Appearance of bookmarks

The bookmarks in nav. drawer appear the same way folders appear in app. Maybe, assigning a different icon for bookmarks and having them appear the same way as different fragments (Settings, About) would make nav. drawer look more consistent.

>Material style icon for New(Plus) and Edit(Pencil)

I think, Dir would look even better, if it had the floating circular icon, as in Gmail for compose, for New and Edit(when selected). The same New(Plus) icon may convert into Edit(Pencil) icon on selecting a file or folder. 

>Adding an option to create a file alongside the option to create folder

As of now, we are able to create new folder with the new folder icon. I think (taking into consideration  above suggestion) adding facility to create new file after tapping the plus icon may add an extra feature.
Many apps have the floating icon, which shows options(which appear as circles above the tapped icon which turns into cross, well you get the point :wink:) when tapped. Maybe the plus icon could be like that.

I'm referencing issue #45 as it is related to this issue.

I understand that it might play a role in increasing app size for no reason, but still I thought to let you know. Even if there may be a case where we used colorful pattern rather than cyan-blue, it might look better

Fix by making the service correctly recognize that the folder was empty and it did compress successfully.

Requirement for this feature is minimal code changes (except for layout files); hopefully still being able to configure the dialog using the same methods (setPositiveButton() etc). 

Maybe look into doing this by subclassing AlertDialog and/or its factories.

_Your content animation has a spatial clash with the path component. The content moves in a way to convey drilling down inside of something but the path component operates more like a stack pushing a new layer on. I'd consider changing the content animation to behavior more like a deck of cards where you push and pop cards onto a stack. Bonus points if you allow bezel swiping a card to pop.﻿_

Components that will need to be themed: 
- ActionBar
- PathBar
- Window color
- Text colors
- All themed components in styles.xml
- Empty state graphics
