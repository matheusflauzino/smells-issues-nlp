When a splay if forced to a leg this is fine. However, usually what happens is you take 3 readings and they do not quiet work, maybe when shooting up an avon. When forcing the 3 shots, Sexytopo treats each one as a new leg and issues a new number. It would be nice to do it intelligently, as Pockettopo does. In Pockettopo you still have to force them individually but it numbers them all the same."

At times when sketching the screen stops responding, sometimes is catches up and draws where the pen has been, at others it is not responding at all, going into move mode and back to drawing seems to help. (this may also happen when moving, but not sure) At times this made it very unusable, I've not seen this when testing at home. It started right at the beginning of the survey, so I doubt it is file size.

At times I think this might be caused by dual touch setting off zoom mode, but at maximum zoom this is hard to tell. Water on the screen might be causing this. I will look into seeing if the galaxy tab can have touch sensitivity turned off so only the pen can be used!"

It is far simpler for the surveyor to have the data appear at the end of the file. This means if legs are taken accidently they are easier to find and remove as it is just the last x stations. It is also important in post processing that the data is in order. If the distoX goes wrong or a team member changes and causes a problem (wearing metal watch or something) and the place where the happened, or at least a place where the survey was definitely correct can be identified, only data after that point has to be binned. The data order is not always the same as the cave passage order."

The text entity could be parsed direct to a scrap (with point label) in the Therion th2 file, but this would be a bit messy.  Firstly all the labels would be in one arbitrary scrap, which may have no relation to the way the survey/drawing author wants to set things out, and it may confuse inexperienced Therion users.
But mainly I don't like the 'raw survey notes in scrap' idea because it blurs the line between survey notes and subsequent drawing or data edits (which is one reason why I believe TopoDROID is flawed).

Currently you have the cross section as perpendicular to the last leg. If it is a station with a single leg, that is the only real automatic option. However. when there are 2 legs, the most common definition and the one that gets it right most often is the perpendicular bisector of the legs. This is what pockettopo, Therion and I believe Survex all use, so it would make sense to use the same as the programme they are likely to be exported to.

I really like the lines showing where the cross sections are, a real nifty feature would be to allow the user to set the direction.

richsmith/sexytopo,closed,2017-11-03 00:03:09,Incorrect way to reverse a leg,[],0,"As stated previously a survey program should record what a survey actual does.

So if a person reads a backwards leg it should be recorded as a backwards leg eg

5    4    10.34    115    +11

However Sexytopo is just changing the measurements and recording

4   5    10.34    295    -11

This causes 2 problems
If you do not know where the station was read from, you might not be able to go back and check for thinks like magnetic interference or know that it was taken away from the interference, something like a anchor in the wall.
It breaks clino calibration, lets take an extreme example, but one I have seen.

On the above data, if the Clino was reading 4 degrees (something I have seen) under the true reading when the survey program corrects the reading it will then use

5    4    10.34    115    +15 (+11+4)

4   5    10.34    295    -7 ((-11+4)

So the way SexyTopo records the data doubles the error for reversed legs when clino correction is applied. 

There are probably lots of other reasons not to change the readings, but the above are the main 2.

Oh and I have just noticed, it does not actually change the sign of the clino reading, so the reversal of a leg is actually wrong, so the elevation plot becomes wrong"

This should not happen, as it is also possible to take 1 reading and make it into a leg, it is important to be able to distinguish the difference, is it is likely that the multiple reading leg is less likely a blunder than the single reading, survex is in the process of taking account of this, I believe.
It is also important as at times, say for avens, the user might have overriden a set of legs that did not become a leg automatically, these are more varied and by just having the export, this cannot be ascertained.
The DistoX also records its rotation when taking a reading, this would be useful to be stored, as a leg with 3 readings with the same orientation is not as likely to be correct as a leg with at least 2 orientations. (I wonder if this should be a different issue)"

richsmith/sexytopo,closed,2016-02-29 22:39:13,Data format seems to depend on locale,[],0,"Hello Rich, and many thanks for your efforts !
I have an issue re-reading data from a saved file in sexytopo, and it seems to be related to the (french) local (if such a notion exists in Android)  of my phone, as it says (in a toast) ""Error:invalid double:2,50"". Please note the comma, as used in France for floating point (even called ""nombre à virgule"", virgule being comma in French) instead of the anglo-saxon dot.
So it seems that the routine that save the data uses the locale and the one that reads them back just ignores the local.

richsmith/sexytopo,open,,Native File Format,[],0,"> Sexytopo doesn't really have a format per se for sketches - it just holds the data in memory as native Android objects and saves it as .json.

With regard to SexyTopo's native save/load format:

Currently survey data is persisted and read in an extremely basic Survex-compatible format. It uses the Survex .svx extension, and consists of absolutely nothing except the raw survey data in Survex default ""data normal"" format.

```
1   2   3.77    299.23  18.23
2   -   5.00    0.00    0.00
2   3   10.00   90.00   0.00
3   4   15.00   180.00  45.00
```

I've got a local branch which implements magnetic declination calculation and correction. This requires persisting and loading the declination value associated with a given survey.

Additionally, there will be more metadata associated with a given survey as the software grows. Examples include the name of the cave, the survey date, perhaps the survey team, etc.

I have implemented a slightly more thorough Survex export/import based upon the following format:

```
*title TestSurvey
*date 2016.01.21
*declination 14.48 degrees

1   2   3.77    299.23  18.23
2   -   5.00    0.00    0.00
2   3   10.00   90.00   0.00
3   4   15.00   180.00  45.00
```

The parser makes it easy to add support for new Survex commands as features warrant them.

The real question, however, is whether a subset of the Survex format is _desired_ as the native SexyTopo format, or whether a SexyTopo-specific format is preferred. My opinion is that the world doesn't need Yet Another Cave Survey Format, and I do like the Survex format (as well as the similar but changed-for-absolutely-no-reason Therion centerline version) but the decision isn't mine to make.

richsmith/sexytopo,closed,2016-03-15 22:01:22,Backsight Shot Promotion,[],0,"This is a simple feature that PocketTopo still doesn't have yet. Similar to the promotion of three duplicate splays as a named shot, this PR recognizes a foresight / backsight pair and promotes it to a named shot as well. Compared to a triple forward shot, a foresight / backsight pair is much more useful at detecting magnetic anomalies (though the currently hard-coded 1.0° azm requirement is quite strict for those of us surveying in basalt rather than limestone).

A few new helper functions were given public visibility so they could be unit tested; I can change this to package visibility if I may move the unit test classes to a more specific package than `tests`.

richsmith/sexytopo,open,,SVG Sketch Export,[],0,"I've started a feature branch for adding SVG sketch export. Ideally this will allow direct vector export at map-scale, layer compatible with Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape, with appropriate metadata so that Walls and Compass can roundtrip morph them along with loop closure.

If you're willing to consider accepting this feature, I'd like to use this ticket for discussing further design and implementation.

Initial working but ""not ready for primetime"" branch is at: https://github.com/riggsd/sexytopo/tree/svg-export

richsmith/sexytopo,closed,2016-01-19 22:22:42,Compass export,[],0,"This PR exports a Fountainware Compass .DAT survey file from the File->Export menu.

Compass support could be improved if the exporter had access to some additional metadata, including: date of the survey, cave name (as opposed to survey name), magnetic declination, per-survey comment, survey team, per-shot comment.

I did not try to define a common Java Interface for ""survey exporters"", but this would make for a better design once more formats are supported.

richsmith/sexytopo,closed,2016-01-19 22:08:37,"Switch ""Declination"" to ""Azimuth""",[],0,"SexyTopo's UI currently uses the term ""declination"" to refer to refer to the magnetic compass measurement. The term ""declination"", however, is more correctly used to refer to a location's Magnetic North offset from True North. This ambiguous usage makes it difficult to add support for magnetic declination correction to the application.

This PR replaces all incorrect usages of ""declination"" with ""azimuth"", so that there will be no confusion when magnetic declination correction is added in the future.

Note that the internal API most frequently uses the term ""bearing"" to refer to compass measurement. PocketTopo now uses the term ""azimuth"" in its UI. And ""azimuth"" is the correct term for a 0 - 360-deg measurement, while ""bearing"" more correctly refers to quadrant + 0 - 90-deg measurement (eg. W70-deg) [see: https://engineering.purdue.edu/~asm215/topics/bearings.html]. If you like, I can replace all internal use of the term ""bearing"" with ""azimuth"" as well, but this PR currently maintains that usage.
