RyuzakiKK/NoteCrypt,closed,2018-10-16 18:08:51,Privacy policy,[],0,"Hi. I'm Harry. 
I'd like to contribute to your project. I'm a content creator and my I help out mostly by creating documents I feel and think projects should have. Privacy Policy Statements, FAQs, About etc. Mostly anything that has to do with text styled with markdown. 
I think it'll be cool to have a privacy policy statement that will put forward your policies to end users about information collection and use but I'm quite certain you don't collect any user information externally. However, it's still a good thing end users are made aware of this.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this.
Thanks"

More languages would be appreciated.

The strings to translate are about 80 and can be found here https://github.com/RyuzakiKK/NoteCrypt/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml

The new translations needs to be placed inside a new folder called values-xx-rXX  under `/app/src/main/res/` where the first xx is the code of the language, and the other XX is the country code. If in doubt just ask."

RyuzakiKK/NoteCrypt,open,,NoteCrypt crashes when trying to save/return to previous screen on Lineage15.1 (8.1 base),[],0,"The tool crashes when trying to either save the database or when trying to navigate inside it.

This behavior hasn't existed on Lineage14.1 which bases on AOSP 7's code, also did I triple check for missing read/write permissions but no dice.

That said, to edit any entry is impossible by now, however, reading entries work when considering that returning a page will make the tool crash."
