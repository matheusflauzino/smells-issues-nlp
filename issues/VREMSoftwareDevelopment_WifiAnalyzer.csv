**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In #145 a hardware address vendor search was added, which I highly appreciate.

However, as already stated in one of the comments, the search is case sensitive, it only works if you type upper case letters. That breaks user expectations and is cumbersome to type with some keyboards.

I consider that a bug, because lower case letters are perfectly valid for a hexadecimal value.

The ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission is required for the wifi scan to

following errors are triggered:

Show WiFi / AP info

### Actual behaviour
Stuck at ""scanning"" with spinning wheel, stating ""no Data""
(This is with location service enabled, just in case)

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
Every time I try to run the app.
Additional note: the ""other"" WiFi Analyzer app also has the same behavior, not showing any data - so I suspect it might have something to do with the system itself (maybe some extra permissions required?)

WiFi hardware can get new signal quality data many times per second. How about an option to have the graphs update ""as fast as possible""?


I could imagine someone saying CPU usage would be an issue. If so, perhaps there's a way to block while waiting for the WiFi hardware to have fresh data.

Another possible objection would be that graphs would scroll too fast. A good solution would be to switch to a graph that uses logarithmic time for the x-axis. Recent changes would take up the most space, with older samples essentially getting averaged together so they take up less."

Currently I can only filter for the 2.4 and 5 GHz accesspoints. I would love to have a single list and than add filters for:

- [ ] Type of Encryption / Features
- [ ] Strength of Accesspoints (eg. only show strong ones)
- [ ] Band (2.4 / 5 GHz)
- [ ] Channel

Maybe you can add this somewhen in the future but even without this it's already a great piece of software.

Thanks for this great open-source tool. :-)

I think the channel rating tool may have a small quirk (or maybe I don't fully understand it?):

I fortunately operate the only AP on the 5 GHz band in range. I've set my OpenWrt router to spawn two SSIDs on the same radio, one which is my ""main"" SSID, then a guest SSID. Both SSIDs are obviously on the same channel, as they are provided by the same radio.

In this case WiFiAnalyzer should not recommend me to move to a different channel, as it should detect it's the same AP (same channel, same BSSID). But it seems to do so, as it always indicates the channel my AP is set to as ""average"" (yellow) or even ""bad"" (red), and shows ""Best Channels: <all the channels I'm not using>"".

Is that a corner-case you didn't consider?

Kind regards,

Ralf
