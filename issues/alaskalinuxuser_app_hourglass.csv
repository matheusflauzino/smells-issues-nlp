I love this open source app and using it quite often. But sometimes my phone is in my pocket and I'm listening to music and I miss the time ended notification ! The vibration is short, easy to miss, same thing for the notifications sounds. I'd find ""logical"" to have a continuous notification that vibrates and rings until I manually stop it (from notification bar or inside app).
Is this feature planned for a future release ? 
Thanks"

For this I'd like the notification to showo me remaning time.

1) when I enter the textfield, the cursor is positioned somewhere. It would be nice to either preselect all minutes or all seconds, depending on where I put the focus.
2) By default, all minutes should be selected, so that I can just start typing the number of minutes I need (and ideally pop up the keyboard automatically as well.
3) When I delete everything and just enter 10, hourglass returns to the main screen, ignoring my entry. It should recognize 10 as 10:00."
