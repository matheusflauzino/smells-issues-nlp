jtmcn/archwiki-viewer,closed,2018-08-07 05:24:52,Privacy Concern,[],0,"I have noticed recently that if I browse the ArchWiki on my device using a browser (so not using archwiki-viewer), I get an additional android-like icon in the browser's address bar which, when clicked, opens archwiki-viewer.

I take it this is due to code in archwiki-viewer as opposed to code in the browser?

And it ""looks"" like browser connections are being tracked by archwiki-viewer or there is some trigger when visiting the the [wiki url](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).with the browser.

This raises a security/privacy concern.

Can you please explain what is going on ""behind the scenes"" and what is the purpose of this ""feature""?  If one is already on the ArchWiki page in the browser, why would one need to open archwiki-viewer then?

It seems the value of archwiki-viewer is to be able to browse the wiki quickly without having the full browser open, etc.

Thanks.
