```
$ ./gradlew clean assemble
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:_debugApk'.
   > Project :app declares a dependency from configuration 'compile' to configuration 'default' which is not declared in the descriptor for project :plugin-commons.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
```

I think I'm missing some inital setup. Can you point me to this?"

The plugin pulls down the cover art, appears to save it, but the artwork doesn't show up. Also, I see different cover art in the album tab, but all in the tracks tab, reguardless of album/artist, have the same album cover."
