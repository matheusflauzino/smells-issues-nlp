/LE: on a second thought, the Tag already points to the wrong commit, not sure it will help F-Droid ( [I've worked around it](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/merge_requests/3473/diffs) ), but at least for consistency."
mikifus/padland,closed,2018-07-16 19:02:00,Allow to open an existing pad by giving the full URL,[],0,"As stated in the summary, it should also be possible to open a pad by just giving the full URL."

mikifus/padland,open,,Recognize URL schemes to propose opening pads directly into Padland,[],0,"It would be really nice to be able to directly open pads URLs, like clicking one anywhere in Android and besides allowing to open it in the browser, also offer to open it into padland.

I'm not sure this is possible as there isn't really a defined URI like `git://` and so on so it would require to use either the whole list of known instances, or some keywords in URLs (risk of false positives I guess)."
mikifus/padland,open,,Add support for MyPads and password-protected pads,[],0,"Some services now rely on MyPads, something on top of traditional pads to manage them with an account, be able to have a ""library of pads"" or protect them with a password.
For example, the one with Framasoft can be found here: https://mypads.framapad.org/mypads/?/login
Trying to open such a document seems as of now to result in a white, empty screen and stuck the application. It's still possible to go back (no crash), but not even a screen stating this is unsupported.

So, this is kind of a double issue, but unsupported pads and so on should be presented as being unsupported, and the best would be to support MyPad and password-protected pads."
mikifus/padland,closed,2018-03-08 13:28:28,"""onReceivedError"" does not execute in API level < 23.",[],0,"Hi,

I found that you have used `onReceivedError(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request, WebResourceError error)` in [PadViewActivity](https://github.com/mikifus/padland/blob/38f7e6651940f8cf603b860d53d9cd99d1935bd8/app/src/main/java/com/mikifus/padland/PadViewActivity.java), which is added in API level 23. However, it does not exist in API level < 22, meaning that the code logic you wrote to handle webview error will not take effect. (See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32769505/webviewclient-onreceivederror-deprecated-new-version-does-not-detect-all-errors))

To fix this issue, add deprecated `onReceivedError (WebView view, int errorCode, String description, String failingUrl)` to make it compatible for API level < 22.

Thanks."

When I try to add the pad to Padland (note: I've added the wikimedia Server to my server list) by entering _thisisonlysomerandomtestcase_ in the field _Pad name_ and press _Create or go to_ I get this message _**The pad name contains invalid characters**_ and the pad is not opened.

Is the name maybe too long?"
mikifus/padland,open,,Hide the chat window,[],0,"When I load a pad, the chat window is always displayed in full size. I think it would be better if it started out minimalised, or smaller at least. Even better would be if the chat window could be displayed on a different panem such that I could swipe left and right to switch between pad and chat window. Thanks!"

mikifus/padland,open,,Framacalc and Framaslide,[],0,"Framasoft, which already provide framapad.org also provide : 

* [Framacalc](https://lite.framacalc.org/), based on Ethercalc. I opened one in Padland. It was difficult, but it works (I assume your app is based on Webview for editing the pads?)

* [Framaslide](https://framaslides.org/login) based on [Strut](https://strut.io/). I didn't try to open one.

Is it possible to add them to the list of servers available in the app, with a special message that this aren't classical pad from Etherpad or framapas, but more something like excel and powerpoint? Also is it possible to add different icons for documents: one for classical ""pads"", one for ""calcs"" and one for ""slides"", so that we can see the different sorts of documents easily?"

I would like to say thank you, mikifus. Padland was one of the first repo (the second one, in fact) I contributed to on Github two years ago. You took some time to help me, and you welcomed me well. That's not a lot, but I will say it again: thank you! 🥇 "

1) Click on Create new Pad

3) Click on Create or go to
4) Error pages show ""Cannot GET /http://pad.riseup.net/p/test

When I look into the pad settings the app tells me that the pad URL is "" http://pad.riseup.net/p/http://pad.riseup.net/p/test""

*Please remove the double occurencie of the URL.* Hopefully works again afterwards."
mikifus/padland,closed,2018-01-05 18:16:19,Where are settings?,[],0,"Sorry if this is a stupid question but not sure if I'm stupid or had some trouble at my end, but I can't find how to reach settings to create a new server.

I'm using 1.3.6 Fdroid version in a CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4).

As you can see at attached image I just have two icons for new group and new pad. This one ask me for name and server but it only offer a list with predefined path.
There are no menu icons at all, the menu button does nothing and no way to slide from side or other ways to show a Preferences menu.

Also as you can see at the screenshot, the path for riseup pad created has the url included twice and does not work.

When trying to use an already created pad from a custom server on HTTPS, if the CA is unknown by Android, a blank white screen is displayed without any error.
Once you install the certificate manually, the pad does display.
Could some kind of error be displayed when the certificate is not known/trusted rather than a blank screen, as not all users would know that it could be an SSL problem.

mikifus/padland,closed,2016-06-08 11:16:27,Requirement on the READ_PHONE_STATE permission,[],0,"Hi there,

I just discovered your interesting app on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/com.mikifus.padland), being a pad junkie myself I'm looking forward to trying it.

When trying to install it though I was a bit puzzled to see that it asks for access to the phone state and identity (`android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`, https://github.com/mikifus/padland/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L14). It also asks for access to the SD card contents and network connection, but those two sound pretty normal for the app's purpose.

I'm a bit touchy about what applications want to access from my personal data, and I'm not sure to understand why knowing the phone state and identity would be relevant. Could you clarify the situation?

Thanks in advance.

_Edit:_ I checked the git history and apparently it has always been required: https://github.com/mikifus/padland/blob/565a289d06380baaa107e33b5b1c45c73a712d58/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L13
