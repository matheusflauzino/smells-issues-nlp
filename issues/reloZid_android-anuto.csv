On this level, the only thing that spawns are the Star healers, and no matter the DPS of my system, there is nowhere near enough dps on any track length to defend against all those healers at once. I basically plan my entire game around it at this point, and still end up losing. 

It's unfortunate because i want to get into more end-game stuff. 

I'd be happy to help out with some contributions, but i'd need some help knowing where to look in the code.

We know that this isnt an classic issue, but i couldn't find an open discussion board about this project...
After looking to that board and found out how far others came and how only far we came (0nly 205.787 points in the original level and the highest 334.892 in the level with the 5 lines for example on this device) we planed to build up a better strategy based of some statistics. First of all we have to gather all data of the different towers like this:

After that we have to build some statistics based abstract from that data and build some new advanced strategy based on that. But before putting any more effort in this we would like to ask if others have done already things in this direction and are willing to share them. Thanks a lot in advance."

+ Use the same spacing at the border as between items in the select level grid
#### Technical:
+ A separate SettingsManager. It now holds back button settings, only

If a tower info fragment is open when user changes its transparency, it now updates instantly. To do that, ThemeManager calls TowerInfoFragment directly.

My suggestions would be (in order of my personal preference):

- a turret that reduces or disables star's healing power temporarily - maybe third upgrade to slow turret?
- do not stack heal effect
- stars can't heal other stars (except self)
- reduce stacking effect for each additional healer in the area
- one heal should heal a fixed number of HP and distribute it among all units in the effect's area (maybe combined with reduced stacking)
 
Other suggestions (in no particular order):

- stars can heal other units but cannot self-heal
- very reduced maximum life
- stars can heal other stars but with less effectiveness
- stars only heal themselves "

It is easy to lose track when there is so much action going on all over the battle-field.

Color-codes or overlay icons will add clutter and make the screen unreadable, therefore I suggest the use of a so-called *quasi-mode*, as defined by Jef Raskin in the book ""The humane interface"".

Unlike a classical mode (e.g. pressing `caps lock`), a quasi-mode is only active for as long as an action is being performed (e.g. holding `shift`).

In the case of this excellent game, there is no more room for buttons and every cell is valuable. There is one exception - the trench itself. That space is technically unused (and that's a lot of real estate). I suggest a `tap and hold` gesture anywhere on the trench to display an overlay above each unit, which will visualize its level.

As soon as the finger is raised, the overlay disappears and the game is rendered as usual. This is a non-invasive approach that doesn't clutter the screen and is very easy to invoke, and most importantly - very easy to dismiss."

I created some new levels, and added a menu to access them. Thanks for considering my additions. This is my first pull request on github, so if I am doing something wrong, please just let me know :)

Not sure if I am meant to discuss implementation details here, but a quick rundown of what I changed:
Added a new MenuActivity
- App now opens to this and allows the user to select a level.
- When a level is chosen, MainActivity is started with an intent extra that specifies which level to load
- added some misc graphics and thumbnails for this activity

Added new levels
- added into res/raw - the levels are clones of the original level except for the platform placement, and path taken by the enemies.

Thanks!

reloZid/android-anuto,closed,2018-09-24 15:12:11,Cheaper to sell and start again than to upgrade,"[Label(name=""balancing"")]",0,"If you enhance a turret, its upgrade price remains the same. This means that if you want to upgrade a tower later, enhancing it now is as good as throwing away the credits. I assume this is intended.

This sort of makes sense, and makes the player think twice before spending money for the short term. Then again, I think the upgrade price should go down even if a little bit when enhancing. Since enhancing increases the sell price, sometimes it gets to a point where it's cheaper to sell a very enhanced turret and start from scratch with a number of upgrades instead of upgrading it directly.

What about reducing the upgrade cost at the same rate that the sell cost is increased? That would nullify this effect.

Those keep track of the first/last in the order in which they were spawned. I would find First/Last in the order in which they are getting to the end more useful.

For example, if I have a sniper turret to catch those that run past my other turrets, I want the First as in the one that's closest to the end. But it will probably not be the first to spawn, as a faster enemy could be the first in progress but not the first to have spawned.

Don't know if these strategies should be added in parallel (with new names) or if they should replace the existing. I don't think I'd ever find the current ones useful.
