gjedeer/mylocation,open,,Feature: Move Converter from Overflow,[],0,"IMHO, the converter is super-useful and deserves to be directly accessible, as a button or expanded, rather than buried in overflow. There is room for it.

gjedeer/mylocation,open,,Feature: Widget or background operation,[],0,"I'm planning to keep this app handy to answer ""where am I?"" in an emergency (e.g. when having to call an ambulance). The typical usecase would be to fire off this app to get my location, and while it searches, call the emergency services (and switch back to the app later to read the address).

However, it seems that once you switch away from the app (e.g. to start a phone call), it stops the location search and the GPS is disabled again. It would be helpful if it could continue searching in the background (perhaps with a notification that can be used to cancel?). Not sure if Android has limitations here, though?

Alternatively, having a widget that can start a search and has a cancel button might be interesting. One such app exists here:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.futonredemption.mylocation&hl=en
https://code.google.com/archive/p/futonic-mylocationwidget/

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194491/34080383-07859d4e-e33d-11e7-8ee2-38a40d0cda88.png)

That app has a few downsides:
 - It is unmaintained
 - It only shows address, not coordinates
 - It does not show how recent the address shown is and does not allow clearing an address once shown
 - The widget interface is minimal (showing the address and possibly position and a button to open up a bigger window is probably bettter).

Still, a similar feature might be useful to add to this app, possibly reusing some code from that app?


Related to this request, it would be helpful if the app would show a notification when the position is found, ideally showing the coordinates and address directly for quick reference."
gjedeer/mylocation,open,,Feature: Enable GPS on a rooted phone,[],0,"I'm planning to keep this app handy to answer ""where am I?"" in an emergency (e.g. when having to call an ambulance). However, I usually have GPS disabled to save battery. In the interest of speed, it would be interesting to have the app enable GPS on startup (and possible disable it again after it gets a fix). I realize that this is not normally possible on Android, but on a rooted phone it should be possible (at least the ""power toggles"" app can do this on a rooted phone)."

Judging from reports on other location libraries and with the Genymotion emulator, I assume my customizations might be an issue, but it seems maybe not?  XPrivacy does not prompt for network access, and others suggest, the providers must be iterated through instead of directly assuming it is accessible.

gjedeer/mylocation,open,,Open link on iPhone,[],0,"Hi. I really like your app. I have an problem though when sharing geo-link with iPhones. It opens the link with the browser and not Google map on the iPhone. Would it be possible to have a Apple link as the first link. It a nice way to make iPhone and Android phones open the geo-link.

The GoogleCode project says GPLv2, but github doesn't show a licene. Also, GPLv2 is incompatible with the Apache2 license used in the support libraries. I'd recommend to switch to GPLv2+ (GPLv2 with the ""and later versions"" addition).

What steps will reproduce the problem?

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
Numbers are localised. E.g. in French, thé décimal delimiter is a comma but 
it should be a dot in thé URL.
Great app, though.




What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
