Is there is any way to run different OS as a base in Termux (instead of Debian-ish OS)?
Yes, I know, that it is possible to run plenty of operation systems inside proot in Termux, but it seems like a bit of overhead, as for me.

 IPython
=========

Tools for Interactive Computing in Python
=========================================

    A Python shell with automatic history (input and output), dynamic object
    introspection, easier configuration, command completion, access to the
    system shell and more.  IPython can also be embedded in running programs.

Usage

    ipython [subcommand] [options] [-c cmd | -m mod | file] [--] [arg] ...

    If invoked with no options, it executes the file and exits, passing the
    remaining arguments to the script, just as if you had specified the same
    command with python. You may need to specify `--` before args to be passed
    to the script, to prevent IPython from attempting to parse them. If you
    specify the option `-i` before the filename, it will enter an interactive
    IPython session after running the script, rather than exiting. Files ending
    in .py will be treated as normal Python, but files ending in .ipy can
    contain special IPython syntax (magic commands, shell expansions, etc.).

    Almost all configuration in IPython is available via the command-line. Do
    `ipython --help-all` to see all available options.  For persistent
    configuration, look into your `ipython_config.py` configuration file for
    details.

    This file is typically installed in the `IPYTHONDIR` directory, and there
    is a separate configuration directory for each profile. The default profile
    directory will be located in $IPYTHONDIR/profile_default. IPYTHONDIR
    defaults to to `$HOME/.ipython`.  For Windows users, $HOME resolves to
    C:\Users\YourUserName in most instances.

    To initialize a profile with the default configuration file, do::

      $> ipython profile create

    and start editing `IPYTHONDIR/profile_default/ipython_config.py`

    In IPython's documentation, we will refer to this directory as
    `IPYTHONDIR`, you can change its default location by creating an
    environment variable with this name and setting it to the desired path.

    For more information, see the manual available in HTML and PDF in your
    installation, or online at https://ipython.org/documentation.html.

Subcommands
-----------

Subcommands are launched as `ipython cmd [args]`. For information on using
subcommand 'cmd', do: `ipython cmd -h`.

Options
-------

Arguments that take values are actually convenience aliases to full
Configurables, whose aliases are listed on the help line. For more information
on full configurables, see '--help-all'.

--debug
    set log level to logging.DEBUG (maximize logging output)
--quiet
    set log level to logging.CRITICAL (minimize logging output)
--init
    Initialize profile with default config files.  This is equivalent
    to running `ipython profile create <profile>` prior to startup.
--autoindent
    Turn on autoindenting.
--no-autoindent
    Turn off autoindenting.
--automagic
    Turn on the auto calling of magic commands. Type %%magic at the
    IPython  prompt  for  more information.
--no-automagic
    Turn off the auto calling of magic commands.
--pdb
    Enable auto calling the pdb debugger after every exception.
--no-pdb
    Disable auto calling the pdb debugger after every exception.
--pprint
    Enable auto pretty printing of results.
--no-pprint
    Disable auto pretty printing of results.
--color-info
    IPython can display information about objects via a set of functions,
    and optionally can use colors for this, syntax highlighting
    source code and various other elements. This is on by default, but can cause
    problems with some pagers. If you see such problems, you can disable the
    colours.
--no-color-info
    Disable using colors for info related things.
--nosep
    Eliminate all spacing between prompts.
--pylab
    Pre-load matplotlib and numpy for interactive use with
    the default matplotlib backend.
--matplotlib
    Configure matplotlib for interactive use with
    the default matplotlib backend.
--autoedit-syntax
    Turn on auto editing of files with syntax errors.
--no-autoedit-syntax
    Turn off auto editing of files with syntax errors.
--simple-prompt
    Force simple minimal prompt using `raw_input`
--no-simple-prompt
    Use a rich interactive prompt with prompt_toolkit
--banner
    Display a banner upon starting IPython.
--no-banner
    Don't display a banner upon starting IPython.
--confirm-exit
    Set to confirm when you try to exit IPython with an EOF (Control-D
    in Unix, Control-Z/Enter in Windows). By typing 'exit' or 'quit',
    you can force a direct exit without any confirmation.
--no-confirm-exit
    Don't prompt the user when exiting.
--term-title
    Enable auto setting the terminal title.
--no-term-title
    Disable auto setting the terminal title.
--classic
    Gives IPython a similar feel to the classic Python prompt.
--quick
    Enable quick startup with no config files.
-i
    If running code from the command line, become interactive afterwards.
    It is often useful to follow this with `--` to treat remaining flags as
    script arguments.
--profile-dir=<Unicode> (ProfileDir.location)
    Default: ''
    Set the profile location directly. This overrides the logic used by the
    `profile` option.
--profile=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.profile)
    Default: 'default'
    The IPython profile to use.
--ipython-dir=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.ipython_dir)
    Default: ''
    The name of the IPython directory. This directory is used for logging
    configuration (through profiles), history storage, etc. The default is
    usually $HOME/.ipython. This option can also be specified through the
    environment variable IPYTHONDIR.
--log-level=<Enum> (Application.log_level)
    Default: 30
    Choices: (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL')
    Set the log level by value or name.
--config=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.extra_config_file)
    Default: ''
    Path to an extra config file to load.
    If specified, load this config file in addition to any other IPython config.
--autocall=<Enum> (InteractiveShell.autocall)
    Default: 0
    Choices: (0, 1, 2)
    Make IPython automatically call any callable object even if you didn't type
    explicit parentheses. For example, 'str 43' becomes 'str(43)' automatically.
    The value can be '0' to disable the feature, '1' for 'smart' autocall, where
    it is not applied if there are no more arguments on the line, and '2' for
    'full' autocall, where all callable objects are automatically called (even
    if no arguments are present).
--colors=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShell.colors)
    Default: 'Neutral'
    Choices: ['Neutral', 'NoColor', 'LightBG', 'Linux']

    Default: ''
    The name of the logfile to use.
--logappend=<Unicode> (InteractiveShell.logappend)
    Default: ''
    Start logging to the given file in append mode. Use `logfile` to specify a
    log file to **overwrite** logs to.
-c <Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.code_to_run)
    Default: ''
    Execute the given command string.
-m <Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.module_to_run)
    Default: ''
    Run the module as a script.
--ext=<Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.extra_extension)
    Default: ''
    dotted module name of an IPython extension to load.
--gui=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.gui)
    Default: None
    Choices: ['glut', 'gtk', 'gtk2', 'gtk3', 'osx', 'pyglet', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'tk', 'wx', 'gtk2', 'qt4']
    Enable GUI event loop integration with any of ('glut', 'gtk', 'gtk2',
    'gtk3', 'osx', 'pyglet', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'tk', 'wx', 'gtk2', 'qt4').
--pylab=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.pylab)
    Default: None
    Choices: ['auto', 'agg', 'gtk', 'gtk3', 'inline', 'ipympl', 'nbagg', 'notebook', 'osx', 'pdf', 'ps', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'svg', 'tk', 'widget', 'wx']
    Pre-load matplotlib and numpy for interactive use, selecting a particular
    matplotlib backend and loop integration.
--matplotlib=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.matplotlib)
    Default: None
    Choices: ['auto', 'agg', 'gtk', 'gtk3', 'inline', 'ipympl', 'nbagg', 'notebook', 'osx', 'pdf', 'ps', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'svg', 'tk', 'widget', 'wx']
    Configure matplotlib for interactive use with the default matplotlib
    backend.
--cache-size=<Int> (InteractiveShell.cache_size)
    Default: 1000
    Set the size of the output cache.  The default is 1000, you can change it
    permanently in your config file.  Setting it to 0 completely disables the
    caching system, and the minimum value accepted is 3 (if you provide a value
    less than 3, it is reset to 0 and a warning is issued).  This limit is
    defined because otherwise you'll spend more time re-flushing a too small
    cache than working

To see all available configurables, use `--help-all`

Examples
--------

    ipython --matplotlib       # enable matplotlib integration
    ipython --matplotlib=qt    # enable matplotlib integration with qt4 backend

    ipython --log-level=DEBUG  # set logging to DEBUG
    ipython --profile=foo      # start with profile foo

    ipython profile create foo # create profile foo w/ default config files
    ipython help profile       # show the help for the profile subcmd

    ipython locate             # print the path to the IPython directory
    ipython locate profile foo # print the path to the directory for profile `foo`

I propose that a new Activity/Service is added (or an extension of `com.termux/.app.TermuxService` to allow use by ADB). You could possibly even allow another app (with user granted permission) to run a command!

This would be BEYOND useful (and a little cool, too), like being able to start up `sshd` and setup port forwarding completely from the computer! You wouldn't even have to unlock the screen, assuming that you have already accepted the computer's RSA Fingerprint on your phone.

I Am aware, that SD card is not so fast like build in chips which are The internal part of every Android device. I also know, that there is no USB HUB, which can power external harddisk and power also connected Android device at The same time. Unfortunately, this HUB donot exist thanks to strange facts.
But why Termux do not allow users to store or access data from external SD card? Or from external harddisk?
Could this make system unstable?
I AM aware, that Android 7.0 and newer do not allow users to store application package to external SD card. And even Android 6.0 allowed this, applications data have been stored in The internal device storage, if application programmer did not make his app so all data were really stored to SD card.

termux/termux-app,open,,Support styled underlines,[],0,"It would be great if support could be added for styled underlines.

Here's a brief overview:
- `\e[4:1m` straight underline
- `\e[4:2m` double underline
- `\e[4:3m` curly underline

**Note**: the colon is strictly required, as something like `\e[4;1mHello\e[0m` would print a bold, underlined ""Hello"" to the console. This is discussed in the [neovim issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7479#issuecomment-348783792).

Support for this was added to neovim in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7479, and in tmux (so far without color support) in https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1492. There's an idea floating around that the underline can be given a color using `58:2:<r>:<g>:<b>` or `58:5:<x11 color>`, similar to how it's done for true colors. From what I've read, `CSI 59` resets the underline color. (I'm not a terminal developer, so please forgive me if I'm butchering these terms).

Here's an example:

I have a basic tf file that just tries to use the aws provisioner.  When I run `terraform init` on my mac or ubuntu hosts, it downloads the plugin without issue.  When I try on termux, I get the following error:

I have read that there are possible issues with the go dns resolver that may cause this, but I'm unsure of how to correct it.  I am able to perform a nslookup on the domain above and get the proper DNS entries returned.

#210 looks to be a similar issue, but they were running go code and terraform is a precompiled binary for linux 64bit.  I am running this on a chromebook with an intel processor.  `dpkg --print-architecture` shows i686.  I was able to install golang and run the sample code from #210 and that worked fine."

termux/termux-app,open,,dpkg for Termux doesn't correctly supports x86-64 Android devices - x86_64 vs x86-64 vs amd64 name of architecture for packages and repo paths dispute,[],0,"I usually install Termux on my `x86_64` devices (more often on Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML Z00A/Z00AD) from Google Play or F-Droid and by default repos in `APT` (`/etc/apt/sources.list`) and architectures in `dpkg` (`/var/lib/dpkg/arch`) configured to support packages only of i686 architecture, but Intel Atom Z3580 CPU in my device supports `x86_64`, `i686` and `arm (ARMv7)` archs well.
And I can not change this behaviour of Termux - `dpkg` doesn't allow to add architecture through `dpkg --add-architecture x86_64`, 'cause character `'_'` in `x86_64` not allowed by `dpkg`, but packages repo (http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64, http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease, http://termux.net/dists/stable/Release) configured exactly with underscore (`'_'`) characters everywhere.
Certainly, I manually install `http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64/dpkg_1.19.0.5_x86_64.deb` and `http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64/liblzma_5.2.4_x86_64.deb` with `dpkg -i --force-all *.deb`, change repos in `APT` and archs in `dpkg` configurations, but whatever I do - this doesn't helps and correct this situation.
So, unfortunately, I cannot install `x86_64` packages, but this relates not only me and has more wide impact, 'cause app doesn't support `x86_64` devices well enough.

Along the same lines, after hitting RET to send the command, the command is echoed back before the actual command's output.  I tried `tsu`, but it suffers from the same problem.

One odd detail I noticed along the way is that while `tty` responds `/dev/pts/0` when I'm not within `su`, it switches to `/dev/pts/1` when I'm in `su`.

These problems do not affect `su` in `adb shell`, so apparently there's some way to ""make it work right"".

whereas in Android 8 it is

All other applications that I use can still access and create files on the sdcard as ususal (and not just their own _Android/data_ directory). I've ran termux-setup-storage again and although it fixed the symlinks to the new sdcard mount it didn't do anything for the permissions. Also tried to reinstall termux but the behavior is the same.

<s>Some stuff remains: I haven't managed to get the property parser to accept arrow keys in termux.properties, if I for example try `extra-keys = [['ESC','/','―','HOME','↑','DEL','-'],['TAB','CTRL','ALT','←','↓','→','PGDN']]` I get:

</s>


Which I suppose is a UTF-8/UTF-16 error, and should be fixable.. 
Writing `extra-keys = [['ESC','/','\u2015','HOME','\u2191','DEL','-'],['TAB','CTRL','ALT','\u2190','\u2193','\u2192','PGDN']]` instead works:

I also think that the keys take up too much vertical space, making the rows smaller would be nice. @xqdoo00o I suppose that this is what you are doing in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/759? But that works only for android 5? I didn't notice any big difference when I merged it (https://github.com/Grimler91/termux-app/tree/configurable_keys_smaller)

Also, more importantly, **we/I need to add more validation of the `extrakeys` field!** If, for example, two rows of different lengths are given the app crashes on start-up (with no change of fail-safe session).

--------------------

I've also set the default extra keys to default to the single row we had before, and made the extra keys visible per default. Users who want several rows can configure it.

We should definitely ship a default termux.properties file with all the different options as comments, they are a bit secret as mentioned in the previous PR.

I've also kept the ""swipe up from - for |"" and ""swipe up from / for \"" features, though they are less needed with configurable keys. "

termux/termux-app,open,,Persistent Home Directory,[],0,"What I'm looking for is a nice, convenient way to store configuration settings for externally running applications in Termux. For example, when I install Midnight Commander (mc) or `pip install youtube-dl` or edit my `~/.vimrc` or `~/.bashrc`, etc... I would like my settings to still exist even when I remove Termux, even by accident (somehow).

Let's say, I give Termux storage permissions (now possible starting with Nougat). So then, somewhere in `/sdcard/` directory, I should then be able to make a directory where I can store dotfiles and settings for applications, like a ""second home folder"" if you will.

Is it as simple as using a home directory symlink, or appending something to $PATH, or is this more complex?

Something more of a streamlined solution would be great to add to Termux!"

termux/termux-app,closed,2018-07-05 15:51:43,Wrong timezone in Go,[],0,"I'm running [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) on my Nexus 5 via Termux (thank you, by the way, for this amazing contribution to humanity) and when I changed the datestamp on a post manually to the current time, I noticed that Hugo did not build my post because it thought the time was in the future. That's when I realised that it had written the date stamp with a timezone of Z while creating the post instead of +01:00 (I'm on Irish Standard Time at the moment).

## Context

  * Time and timezone on the phone is set and displayed correctly
  * In a Termux session, `date` produces the right time and date and timezone (IST)
  * getprop persist.sys.timezone produces the correct timezone (Europe/Dublin)

## To replicate

The following basic Go app produces the wrong timezone consistently for me both under plain Termux and under termux-chroot:

```go
package main

import ""time""
import ""fmt""

func main() {
  p := fmt.Println
  t := time.Now()
  p(t.Format(time.RFC3339))
}
```

## Sample output

```bash
date
Wed Jul  4 16:48:28 IST 2018

getprop persist.sys.timezone
Europe/Dublin

go run time.go
2018-07-04T15:48:37Z
```

So Go thinks its on UTC even though we're on IST.

## Update

I’ve just verified on my Mac that this is erroneous behaviour in Termux and not an anomaly specific to Go. The output of the same script and the corresponding `date` results are in the screenshot below: 

<img width=""731"" alt=""screen shot 2018-07-04 at 17 28 38"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41798/42287790-b82edb06-7faf-11e8-8365-9f90b5dbbe30.png"">

## Update 2

As a further check, the issue does not exist in Node.js under a Termux session. The following code:

```javascript
let t = new Date().toTimeString()
console.log(t)
```

Produces:

```bash
17:38:36 GMT +0100 (IST)
```"

As you can see, although both storage paths' owner group changes from `sdcard_rw` to `everybody` after the permission is granted, the group permission of that of the real SD card changes from `rwx` to `r-x`.

From the data/etc/platform.xml in current platform/frameworks/base master, I can see that the group `sdcard_rw` (along side with `media_rw`) is provided by an undocumented permission named `WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE`. Therefore, proposing to add the permission to the manifest.

termux already converts up/down swipes into mouse wheel events, so you can scroll. In `vim`, these can be mapped like:

```
  map <ScrollWheelUp> <C-Y>
  map <ScrollWheelDown> <C-E>

But `vim` can also accept horizontal mouse wheel events:

```
  map <ScrollWheelLeft> z<Left>
  map <ScrollWheelRight> z<Right>
```

But termux doesn't seem to be generating them.

This seems like it would be simple to add, and it wouldn't interfere with the swipe from the left to bring up the window list and keyboard/new session, because that starts from the edge of the display.

From time to time I am using termux in combination with dcraw and imagemagick to convert camera raw images to my need ""on the go"". This works great, thank you all for that.

There's an SSH app I use called JuiceSSH which gave me this idea, plus when a command doesn't execute properly & it hangs I cannot stop the hanging, nor can I even make termux exit, which forces me to reboot my phone because termux creates a notification that I can't make close...
I have to type exit in order to get termux to exit, that's not good, perhaps you guys could make it so we can close the app from outside of the app?? A feature to change the text colour would also be cool, it would be easier to read the text if it were bright-ish green on a black background for example.
arrow keys would also be a huge help, that way we can cycle through previous commands, its kind of annoying having to re-type the same command on a touch-screen.

termux/termux-app,open,,chromeos: better support for using terminal mouse events AND selection/copy?,[],0,"I use Termux (latest available in Play Store) on ChromeOS (66.0.3359.203 on an Asus C301S) and run a number of console programs that can accept terminal mouse input (emacs, weechat, tmux). When a console program accepts mouse input, Termux passes the mouse events through and it works nicely, but at the same time, it disables the long-press to open the selection menu. Thus, my choice is to use terminal mouse events XOR to be able to copy text from Termux to ChromeOS. (Note: paste from ChromeOS to Termux is unaffected, b/c the hardware keyboard Ctrl+Alt+V allows it to work.)

I have currently handled this by explicitly disabling terminal mouse events in my Termux dotfiles. However, this is suboptimal because it represents a (currently the only) difference between my regular Linux dotfiles and Termux dotfiles, and using the mouse in console programs is occasionally useful. If I can get a way of using terminal mouse events AND copying text from Termux to ChromeOS, then I can use a single set of dotfiles for both environments.

I'm thinking of two alternative ways to solve this:

1. A new hardware keyboard shortcut to activate the selection menu. This would probably be the easiest, but I'd rather avoid making more Termux shortcuts that might conflict with peoples' existing keybindings.

2. Provide a way to switch from the regular popup menu (activated by keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+M) to the selection menu. You can currently switch from the selection menu to the regular popup menu by clicking the ""More..."" button; perhaps there could be a ""Selection..."" button to switch from the regular popup menu to the selection menu?

Another alternative that I'm guessing would be more complex to implement:

3. Gnome Terminal has a similar issue that terminal apps accepting mouse events disables its built-in mouse actions. With Gnome Terminal, when you hold the Shift key, mouse events are handled directly by Gnome Terminal and not passed through to the app running in the terminal.

Any thoughts or ideas?"

termux/termux-app,open,,Alt-V volume keybinding interferes with readline,[],0,"Firstly, thanks for this amazing project.  I use it all the time.

One quirk I noticed... while Ctl-V (volume down - V) works beautifully for page-down, alt-v (for page up) does not and instead loads volume control.
While I understand need to access volume, one can easily navigate to diff android app to adjust volume, but having the volume up key more consistent with alt or meta key would I think be most important. 

This is more than just with Alt-V (paging up in emacs / less / etc), but with Alt-D as well  (delete following word)
Here's a cheat-sheet with bindings: http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html

I'm happy to try to submit a PR, but since this would change existing behavior, wanted to file an issue.

TL;DR I respectfully suggest that Volume Up key acts more consistently as Alt (or meta key) for better readline support

Given that file extensions are usually case insensitive and the library appears to only recognize lower-case variants (tried .html, .doc and .txt), and that digital cameras often store uppercase letters, I suggest that lowercasing the extension before [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/termux/filepicker/TermuxDocumentsProvider.java#L199) as a mitigation.

(I can't tell whether there might be better ways than using webkit's mimetypemap (maybe libmagic?) -- but lowercasing would mitigate the immediate issue).

termux/termux-app,open,,Add hundreds of downloadable fonts to termux (discussion),[],0,"So I modded the [Termux-Styling](https://github.com/termux/termux-styling) app to support android's new [downloadable font](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/downloadable-fonts) feature, but I ran into two issues that need resolving:

*  Downloadable fonts requires a valid font provider.  The most popular one is Google Play, but that means that Google Play is required to be installed to get access to them.  No big deal, can fallback to the current bundled fonts if it's not installed.

*  The thing is though, when you request one of the downloadable fonts, you're handed a [TypeFace](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface) object, NOT a .ttf file, which is what the Styling app currently needs to save for the Termux app to use.   You can easily [go from a font file to a TypeFace object](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html#createFromFile(java.io.File)), but not vice versa.  So while I can currently get the Typeface in the styling app, there's not much I can do with it.

There is another option, which is to use Google's font API to get the actual URI to the .ttf file for the font, and then use the Termux Styling app to download that file and copy it into the right place.  This wouldn't require modifying anything in Termux app, but it would require entering a ([freely available](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey)) API key to be able to access that and that might be too annoying to add this.  Might also as a FOURTH option make a list of all the .ttf paths but that may change in the future.

The question-- would it make more sense to just add the downloadable font support to the termux app itself?  It would barely add any size to the app footprint (in fact could make it smaller if you're not loading all those unused fonts in Styling) and fonts are cached by Google Play and reused between apps.  Downside would be that (1) this doesn't affect color stuff, (2) it does have the Google Play dependency and so wouldn't add much for FDroid users, and (3) I am unclear as to whether then you move the color support into termux app or keep the styling or what.

Just throwing it out there if anyone wants to offer any thoughts or opinions."

termux/termux-app,open,,Console renders standard variants as emoji's,[],0,"Greetings,

it seems according to
http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.html
that a number of unicode characters have 2 variations (text style and emoji style).

And Termux renders (at least for the suit characters ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) in emoji style which is wrong for a terminal, especially when those characters appears in a curses app. The emoji style will actually override the color assigned by the curses app.

To reproduce, just copy paste the following into the terminal: ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣
This does not happen in the Cygwin Shell or the Tera Terminal.

termux/termux-app,closed,2018-05-05 22:45:02,Docs on how to write keyboard events to the session,[],0,"Hi, I'm working on creating a Unity plugin that will allow Termux to render to a texture.

I'm having trouble figuring out what the format is for specifying modifiers and special keys like `backspace` for [TerminalOutput.write](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/terminal-emulator/src/main/java/com/termux/terminal/TerminalOutput.java#L15).

I've got regular keys working and the keyboard handles shifting to uppercase, but everything else seems like a mystery at the moment.

I found the [KeyHandler](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/terminal-emulator/src/main/java/com/termux/terminal/KeyHandler.java) class, but there doesn't seem to be any documentation on how it works or what the arguments really mean.

Could you give me a pointer for explaining how I could process an Android [KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent) being emitted when the backspace is pressed so that I can get the general gist of how this works?"

From what I have learned, the process should be: run termux-setup-storage, and allow the permission when the pop-up shows up. I have done that multiple times, and the ""storage"" directory is created, but it doesn't contain the symlink to ""external"". If I run ""df"", I can see how the USB disk is already mounted in /storage (read only), but, as I say, the symlink is not created.

After checking, I noticed that, in the Termux settings page, under ""Permissions"", there is no Storage permission available for enabling or disabling, only a ""Memory"" permission, which is already enabled. Could this be the reason of ""$HOME/storage/external"" not being created?. If so, is there any way to make the Storage permission appear?, or is this a bug?

termux/termux-app,open,,Termux:Sudo Addon proposal,[],0,"Hi,

I recently started to use Termux. And I find it very interesting. For years I have used other Linux-on-Android systems; but I think this project is superior: simple and effective.

After this short intro I propose a new idea around the “su” and “sudo” commands. Please, note that this isn’t a request of “how to use root in Termux” or “scripts for sudo”. I know about such tools, and this is a _different_ proposal:

- The problem: If you grant the root permission to Termux, then _any_ script running inside it can obtain root privileges (very bad!).

- The solution: Create a new Termux Add-on, called Termux:Sudo. This addon will be another _different_ Android App. This new application will have an structure similar to Termux:API, so it can communicate with the Termux shell environment. But this new app focuses on running processes with elevated privileges. In consequence, this Termux:Sudo is the _only_ app that needs to receive the root privileges.

- The implementation: The new Termux:Sudo will maintain an internal password for root (obfuscated) and a list of grant commands (or ‘*’ for all). So the function is very similar to the “sudo” command, and configured in the same way. Note that the data of Termux:Sudo App is _inaccessible_ from the Termux environment, so the password and configuration is even secure.

- The use: When you call for example “sudo nano /system/build.prop” a password command is presented prior to execute the binary.

What you think about this idea?

However, when I launch Emacs and attempt such a command from with Emacs (whether in eshell, from an elisp program, with M-!, etc.) I get either a hang (which fortunately is interruptable with Ctrl-g) or a segfault. An example is termux-open. If, again within Emacs, I launch the command with 'bash termux-open"" I get an error 127. A few things work, like termux-info. The difference seems to be anything that eventually invokes ""am"" in its script, and the ""bash termux-open"" example in fact points to the line containing ""am"" in the termux-open script (""am broadcast ..."").

I tried to find the point of failure in ""am"" and I /think/ but cannot be certain or verify that the problem occurs when ""am"" reads arguments. 

It's hard to see what's different when running inside Emacs except for environment variables. But it's frustrating as the ability to use things like termux-open, termux-clipboard-*, etc., would be really a big benefit."

termux/termux-app,closed,2018-06-21 22:21:33,Terminal output speed issues,[],0,"This is probably the same as #218 and #368, but I felt that they might not describe the problem adequately.

Terminal output is too slow on many different occasions. When Termux cannot keep up with produced output, it stutters at best and becomes unresponsive for minutes at worst. As far as I can tell, using ANSI escapes (for colors, ncurses ui, etc.) makes things even worse.

Most typical manifestations in my experience:
* Scrolling in `less` and similar utilities. Scrolling down is fine, scronling up redraws whole screen and lags like hell.
* Build logs. Use minimal verbosity and you should be fine. Up verbosity a bit or get a lot of warnings due to a typo in a header, and your terminal is busted. Screen updates once every few seconds, and you'll be catching up with an already finished build for many minutes. (I usually just kill Termux and reconnect to my `tmux` session.)

This has been happening for a long while, half a year at very least. However, after one of the most recent updates (noticed on 0.60), the problem got *much* worse. On my Samsung tablet running Android 5.1.1, 80x25 terminal is mostly bearable, while on 190x40 `vim` takes _almost a minute_ to start and regularly hangs for a few seconds (e.g. on newline entry). Not nearly as bad on my phone running 6.0.1, but still noticeable. 

I haven't yet looked at source code (don't have time right now, neither do I have Android app development experience), but I intend to unless it's fixed in a week or two. I suspect excessive syncing among pty and UI threads and maybe inefficient scrollback handling."

termux/termux-app,closed,2018-02-06 19:23:34,Fix for #572: merge ~/storage instead of del,[],0,"We could recursively delete, as in the method above, but that would
require a separate try block for a separate logcat message, or a
different method that returns a flag. I prefer merging in case of custom
folders. Another alternative may be to send an exit code or something for
the termux-setup-storage script to detect and echo an error message."
termux/termux-app,closed,2018-02-15 01:15:26,Root shell doesn't recognize non-character keys,"[Label(name=""Feedback needed"")]",0,"Please check the [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33077154/35867399-edf137cc-0b59-11e8-802b-8201f7ab4d97.gif) I recorded. Non-character keys are actually handled as expected, but immediate visual response only represents the related escape sequence - it's difficult, when not impossible, to take advantage of auto-completion, history and such. This happens in Termux with both `su` and `tsu` scripts and is keyboard-independent; root shells behave correctly in other terminal apps and over adb.

termux/termux-app,open,,Handling ACTION_EDIT in TermuxOpenReceiver,[],0,"Firstly, thanks so much for making such an awesome app!  I love termux.

I'm trying to launch an external activity from within termux while giving it the ability to write to a file (or, if possible, a FIFO).

It would appear that TermuxOpenReceiver can almost handle my needs, except that it is currently only designed to handle read-only access.  Having the ability to edit files from other apps would be very useful for me.

I would therefore kindly request that TermuxOpenReceiver handle `ACTION_EDIT`, in which case it would add the flag `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` as well as open the file descriptor using `ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_WRITE`.  (Perhaps it is also necessary to add an `android:writePermission` attribute to the `<provider>` tag in AndroidManifest.xml?)

Finally, it is currently restricted to files only due to an `isFile()` check.  Could it be changed to `exists()` instead?  I'm hoping that I could get it to work with a named pipe rather than a regular file so that I could pipe data from the activity back to the terminal."
termux/termux-app,open,,Better hotkey support for hardware keyboards,[],0,"On Chromebooks and external keyboards without physical PgUp, PgDown, Home, etc. keys it'd be great to have hotkey support within Termux.

While users could of course switch the row with special keys off by long-pressing on the ""keyboard"" button, I think this is unnecessarily cumbersome.

I would like to suggest to implement either one of the following changes:

1. Hide the row, when the on-screen keyboard is hidden.

Also While F1-F12 show the same output in sh on both system, the output produced for some keys in bash is different.
Term variable is correctly identified as ""xterm"" on both system and stty shows the same settings.
Is there any setting I've missed or is this really a bug in the arm build of bash?"

I noticed that when starting sshd and then exiting Termux, one can still acess the sshd server. Now it's normal given that it's a daemon and it should be running, but I still wanted to open a ticket for two main reasons:
- If it's not the desired behavior and it is a bug, then probably add it to the pending list.
- If it's not a bug, maybe reconsider the pros and cons of such policy, because particularly for SSHd and no _fail2ban-like_ system, it could pose a threat to the user if the sshd server is always running.

first of all, thanks to all working on this amazing android application. It is really great to being able to run my complete work environment on my phone. 

I have noticed that fullscreen option was missing, I have looked at recent commits and it looks that it was removed from sources. Is there other way how to achieve the same result? Or could we keep it for users who use it? I for myself can live with its quirks, but without it, I get that annoying bar with clock and virtual buttons on the screen taking precious pixels from the important content.

Is there a way how to get it back?

termux/termux-app,closed,2017-12-08 23:59:10,Ansi sequence for clicks sometime out of range,"[Label(name=""bug report"")]",0,"Hi!

I noticed that the ANSI escape sequences that Termux send to applications that corresponds to clicks sometimes are out of range. This happens when clicking between the display and the keyboard. This has the unfortunate consequence that it confuses applications like Emacs.

Background:

When touching the Termux screen, the following escape sequence is emitted:

    ESC [ < 0 ; COL ; LINE M ESC [ < 0 ; COL ; LINE m

Where COL and LINE represent the column and the line if the click, encoded as ascii strings.

When clicking on the first line, the LINE is ""1"". When clicking on the last line of, say, a display ten lines high, it is ""10"".

The problem occurs if you tap the screen a little bit below the display, but above the keyboard. Then LINE will be ""11"", which is out of range. This, unfortunately, triggers Emacs into believing that you clicked on the menu bar.

I haven't checked if the same problem exists for COL, but presumably it does.

If you want to check the escape sequences that Termux emits, you can start Emacs. Click on various locations and then type C-h l (which runs the command `view-lossage`). You will also note that if you tap very low on the screen, the text ""Menu Bar (up/down ..."" appears in the minibuffer, which it shouldn't.

This doesn't appear to be a problem when the keyboard is hidden.

For this purpose I get rid of the onscreen keyboard and use a finger to scroll the text up. However, sometimes for some unknown reason the movement of the finger is interpreted as ""pinch zoom"" gesture and the font size is increased or decreased. This is very annoying as one has to bring it back to how it was and it is never exactly that, the difference in font sizes causing eye strain (this is the same reason, btw, why you can't use ""auto-crop margins"" function in a pdf/djvu document reader if your book has stuff in the margins, because then the font size of text will change from page to page and your eyes will become tired very quickly).

So, if there was a way to disable ""pinch zoom"" i.e. ignore such gestures in Termux, it would be very useful. Then, such ""misinterpreted scroll up attempt"" would simply be ignored and one would have to scroll it again, without having to pinch-resize the screen. Thank you."

termux/termux-app,open,,Convert text navigation gestures into arrow key inputs,[],0,"The Blackberry PRIV and KEYone have gesture capable physical keyboards that allow the moving of the text cursor in standard text inputs, in a mode known as ""fine cursor control"". It would be great to translate these smoothly into arrow key inputs, to allow fast bash history scrollback, and cursor navigation in programs like vim.

Currently, the ""Up"" and ""Down"" gestures already trigger the up and down arrow keys in Termux, but not in a smooth or predictable manner. The left and right gestures currently do nothing.

It's likely that this support would also cover software keyboards that allow cursor movement through built in controls and gestures.

The Blackberry Captivate Keyboard Integration Guide is [here](https://community.blackberry.com/docs/DOC-10328), however it mainly relates to using the keyboard as a trackpad/scroll wheel, which isn't the case when the keyboard is in text input mode (like it always is in termux).

Snap, crackle, pop, until you *force stop*. No other way to stop it. Termux freezes, so you can't Ctrl+C, hit Exit on the notification, or swipe away.
Need I say more?

Ideas:
* Have a minimum delay between bells, probably 25 ms (half vibration time) at the least. This will fix the crackling from the Vibrator trying to activate before it is ""ready"". If we get any bell signals during that delay, we will wait until that delay is over, then beep/vibrate once:
``` 
Signals: bell bell bell bell bell bell bell bell bell
Output:  bell                bell                bell

> ""Like many callbacks from the system, the methods on this class are called from the main thread of your process."" — [ServiceConnection documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ServiceConnection.html)

`Not allowed to start service Intent ... without permission not exported from uid 10205`

Does this mean that script starting is not implemented, not allowed due to security reasons, or something else?

It is no problem to prompt the user to launch the robot manually, but i like simplicity, and most of the users wont be terminal-heads, and this seemed a very good solution.

(launching code)
```java
    public void launchRobot() {
        File file = new File(""/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/node"");
        Uri scriptUri = new Uri.Builder().scheme(""com.termux.file"").path(file.getAbsolutePath()).build();

        Intent executeIntent = new Intent(ACTION_EXECUTE, scriptUri);
        executeIntent.setClassName(""com.termux"", TERMUX_SERVICE);
        executeIntent.putExtra(EXTRA_EXECUTE_IN_BACKGROUND, true);
        executeIntent.putExtra(EXTRA_CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY, ""/data/data/com.termux/files/home/robot/"");
        executeIntent.putExtra(EXTRA_ARGUMENTS, new String[]{""main.js""});

        Intent wakeLockIntent = new Intent(""com.termux.service_wake_lock"");
        wakeLockIntent.setClassName(""com.termux"", TERMUX_SERVICE);

        startService(executeIntent);

Basically emacs relies on the `TZ` environment variable value to show the time correctly -- [[Source][2]].

Copying @Neo-Oli as he helped me confirm this issue. He uses `export TZ=$(getprop persist.sys.timezone)` in his `~/.bash_profile` to get around this issue.

Can this (the `TZ` variable) be set by default?

termux/termux-app,closed,2017-12-03 13:06:49,Linux capabilities are not effective,[],0,"Hi,
I've compiled `setcap` and `getcap` for Android and tried to assign `cap_net_bind_service` capability to `sshd`, so I can get it running on port `22` instead of `8022`.

The capability gets set and hence it should work as I am running kernel that supports capabilities. However after restarting the `sshd` process it fails to run without any error message - obviously it won't boot because of the port change (I've tried ports 22, 555). It will start just fine when I return to `Port 8022` in `sshd_config`. I also tried this with SELinux in `Permissive` mode just in case.

I am trying to use termux on a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4"" with 16GB internal and 64GB external storage. Tablet is running LineageOS 13.0 (aka Android 6.0.1). Further, I am using nmilosevic's recipe for installing Fedora 25 and 26 under Termux. The problem I am running into relates to Google's inexplicable lack of support for ext4 on external SD cards and the two options I see for using an external SD card with Termux:

1) If I use my external SD card in ""adopted storage"" mode, Android formats it as ext4 (good), but then I can't move the Termux application to it. Further, termux-setup-storage does not recognize or make links to the external SD card. (In fact, of my ""linuxy"" apps, only XServer SDL, AndSMB and Hacker's Keyboard appear to be movable, pretty much - for me - defeating the purpose of the external SD card.) I run out of space on the internal SD card fairly quickly, with lots of space wasted on the external SD card.

2) If I use my external SD card in ""portable storage"" mode, then termux-setup-storage creates links to the external SD card (under /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage) but since Android formats this as some ridiculous FAT variant (bad), it is useless for installing Fedora onto or for building any of the Linux software that I have written, which exploits/requires UNIX file system permissions.

Consequently, I request that you add the capability of moving the Termux application to external ""adopted"" storage. By the way, I don't really care that Android thinks my external SD card is ""slow"" compared to the built-in memory. I can live with slow better than I can live with lack of function.

Your Termux application is - by far - the best Linux under Android solution that I have seen. Unfortunately, all seem to be afflicted by Google's apparent refusal to ""support"" ext4 - despite using ext4 for Android... I hope the ""move"" feature is straight-forward to implement. Alternatively, do you have any guidance for how I can accomplish this move?

Thank you!

termux/termux-app,open,,"Termux slows down in ""doze mode"" (battery optimization) even with the wake lock",[],0,"This is not really a bug, but rather an ""improvement request"".

When Termux runs using the Wake Lock, the performance greatly slows down because of ""Doze"" (explained in details here: https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html)

> If a user leaves a device unplugged and stationary for a period of time, with the screen off, the device enters Doze mode. In Doze mode, the system attempts to conserve battery by restricting apps' access to network and CPU-intensive services. It also prevents apps from accessing the network and defers their jobs, syncs, and standard alarms.
> Periodically, the system exits Doze for a brief time to let apps complete their deferred activities. During this maintenance window, the system runs all pending syncs, jobs, and alarms, and lets apps access the network.
> As soon as the user wakes the device by moving it, turning on the screen, or connecting a charger, the system exits Doze and all apps return to normal activity

This means if you're connected with SSH on Termux, it will suddenly get really laggy (until you wake it up again), even worse if you use Termux as a web server.

Example:

* Open Termux
* Open a large manpage using less as the pager.  The `bash` manpage is a good example.
* Skip to the end of the page (`G`).  From here:
* Single-line scrollback is relatively quick:  `k`
* Multi-line scrollback starts lagging:  `10k`
* A larger scrollback of 100 lines takes ~25 seconds:  `100k`
* Skipping to the top of the file sees a few seconds of lag, but not as much as the large scrollback:  `1G`

Vim noticeably _doesn't_ suffer from this (thankfully).  Pagers though do.

I'm looking to see if there's a way to access the Termux environment from another terminal to confirm my hunch.  The stock Android terminal environment cannot access the Termux files :(

On termux we have problems to get things working. It seems that android uses a special API usb-serial-for-android for USB OTG, that bypasses the Linux kernel. Maybe our analysis is not correct. Anyway using Node Red on an unrooted tablet would be a great option for many IoT applications.

Has anybody solved the problem?

termux/termux-app,open,,Inconsistent touch response behavior within multiple pane screen session,[],0,"When running a newly created `screen` session with vertically and/or horizontally split panes, the touch screen can be used to select a pane within `screen`, but many touch screen interactions with command line programs (notably scrolling) do not function for programs such as `less` and `man` that are run inside of `screen` windows, even though such interactions work as expected when tested outside of `screen` (`emacs` is a notable exception; both cursor placement and scrolling function as expected for an `emacs` instance that's running inside of a `screen` window).

However, if a `screen` session is detached and then reattached, the touch screen interacts differently for both `screen` and the programs that are run inside of it. `screen` panes can no longer be selected with the touch screen (requiring the use of the C-a Tab key combo instead), but programs that are run within `screen` windows (`less`, `man`, etc.) appear to interact with the touch screen in the same way that they would if they were run outside of a `screen` session.  An exception to this generalization is the `bash` shell itself; while `bash` doesn't accept input from the touch screen when run outside of `screen`, a `bash` instance that is running inside of a reattached `screen` session seems to process movement across the touch screen as if presses of the arrow keys were being made.

I imagine that it might not be technically feasible to allow the touch screen's input to reliably affect both `screen` (through selecting window panes) and apps running inside of `screen` (through scrolling and other interactions) at the same time.  In any case, it may be desirable to adjust the behavior of `screen` in Termux such that the behavior of newly spawned `screen` sessions and newly attached `screen` sessions is the same in order to create a more consistent user experience.

In case it's of relevance, I quote my Termux environment's .inputrc below.  I have a few other environment files (including a .bashrc and .screenrc), but no others seem potentially related to this issue; let me know if you'd like to see any other files.

In Google+ has been mentioned, that Termux should potentially be re-sizable right now. I've tested it with a DeX-Station and found out, that it does not work (see attached Screenshot).

## Improvements that could be made

- Add support for fullscreen
- Add support for re-sizing of the App

I am happy to help with this by testing the App! Just let me know :)

termux/termux-app,open,,Use of usb serial port - e.g. Node.js/serialport/johnny five,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"tl;dr;
I have been attempting to use Node.js on termux to speak to a serial converter on a usb port (Tablet->OTG->USB->Arduino).  Have had a few issues with Node/Serial.  This is partly issue/potential planning for a pull (haven't done one before)

full version,
When trying to open the /dev/tty as per the node-serialport example

https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport

var SerialPort = require('serialport');
var port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty-usbserial1', {
  baudRate: 57600
});

I tried ttySAC01 and a few others that were present in /dev but am getting 

Error: Error: Permission denied, cannot open /dev/ttySAC0
    at Error (native)

first line gives this
WARNING: linker: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/node-ardx/node_modules/serialport/build/Release/serialport.node has text relocations. This is wasting memory and prevents security hardening. Please fix.

I made a fork of termux-app and added this line to the AndroidManifest.xml

 <uses-feature android:name=""android.hardware.usb.host"" />

but as yet haven't had luck.

I know it's possible on android (non-rooted) through java (See https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android) and i found a C/JNI one too.  I looked at another option which creates a 'symlink' type tty device (pseudo tty) but this fails due to permissions also.  I've seen the minicom package - but not sure how it is used to connect to serial (i skimmed through the code but can't see where it hooks into serial)

Is this a matter of adding more permissions to termux? or would it involve more involve coding to make a pretend /dev device?  I figured it would be more usable to have it available through termux than building up a java app specifically for it.  Another use case is Node-RED.

Post-snowden we should know that metadata matters and the list of installed packages is a big source of metadata, which can easily be protected by using HTTPS.

Quite recently also Debian acknowledges that and [provides Onion services for apt-get now](https://guardianproject.info/2016/07/31/howto-get-all-your-debian-packages-via-tor-onion-services/). I think going so far for Termux would be too much (at least for a default config), but HTTPS should be the baseline nowadays.

However it has to be said that the way HTTPS is used at https://termux.net/ is not good right now as it uses Cloudflare. And as Cloudflare [is MITM](https://scotthelme.co.uk/cloudflares-great-new-features-and-why-i-wont-use-them/) [build-in](https://medium.com/@karthikb351/airtel-is-sniffing-and-censoring-cloudflares-traffic-in-india-and-they-don-t-even-know-it-90935f7f6d98#.s6tuvsrzy) in may not be the best choice.

termux/termux-app,open,,Run Termux scripts from Android Debug Bridge [How to],"[Label(name=""information"")]",0,"**Run Termux scripts from Android Debug Bridge**

If you want to run a Termux script from adb use one of the following methods:

**Method 1:**  
This method will run the script regardless of whether a Termux shell is already running not.  
However you have to allow adb root access on your phone.

```
adb shell am startservice -n com.termux/com.termux.app.TermuxService -a com.termux.service_execute -d /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/script.sh
```

The -d option is the path/script-name that you want to run.  

If you don't want to allow adb root access you can use the following:

**Method 2:**

```
adb shell am start -n com.termux/com.termux.app.TermuxActivity
adb shell input text '/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/script.sh'
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

The 1st line opens a Termux shell  
The 2nd line types in the path/script-name  
The 3rd line presses the enter key  

**Warning:** This method will bring to the forefront a Termux shell if one is currently running and use it. If it is not sitting at a waiting bash prompt, the script will not run.

If you want to kill any running Termux shells to insure that the script runs use the following:

```
adb shell am force-stop com.termux
```

This will kill all running Termux shells and everything associated with it.

**Note:**  
The script doesnt have to be in the .shortcuts directory.  
Thats only a requirement of termux-widgets.

Right now pressing Volume Down or enabling the modifier keys (CTRL, ALT) from the extra keys view does not trigger the corresponding Alt + Up, Ctrl + Right etc. Even pressing the keyboards own shift key doesn't produce a Shift + Up.

termux/termux-app,open,,Terminal emulation: blinking cursor?,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"I'm not sure it's a bug, because the last time I dug into the intricacies of Unix terminal definitions was really long ago, and I ran away screaming. But it kind of presents a practical problem:

The cursor does not natively blink, and Emacs can't _make_ it blink.

Also, the result of running `tput cnorm` and `tput cvvis` commands is identical, a rectangle cursor, when the first one is supposed to produce an underscore cursor, so something is very probably wrong.

This is kind of a problem in Emacs, because when background is used for highlighting _(i.e. on TODO items in org-mode)_ the block cursor can become completely invisible while over the highlighted text, and blinking cursor becomes a necessity.

termux/termux-app,open,,big crash bug,"[Label(name=""bug report"")]",0,"hi,

i tyed to open the the conext menu on the android terminal emulator while a attached tmux session was generating a lot of output. it wasnt easy because conext menu got closed everytime (and that happened rappedly) when output changed. Just as i thought i made it ive got an app crash message. And not only that the terminal emulator crashed only, it crashed also all running tmux sessions and other not attached processes i had running in background.

So please do following fixes:
- make terminal emulator independent from processes started through it!!! ( i thought android had services for that...)
- fix that crash
- reimplement the context menu so it is also usable while output is generated rappedly
- maybe also add the context menu options to the side panel

here is some logcat output i have captured after the crash (device running cyanogenmod 13):

It took me a while to figure out why the escape key on my bluetooth keyboard isn't working, but once I found out that it's sending KeyCode 4, which is KEYCODE_BACK, I've been able to fix this through `termux.properties`.

But now I have another problem - the key for Home cursor move (Fn+Left) is not getting registered at all, (tested with `vtshowkeys`) even though it's sending keycode 122, which _should_ be MOVE_HOME. It is otherwise identical to the Left key _(same Meta State, same source, same keyboard type, the only thing different is the key code)_ so it should, in theory, work, but doesn't.

As a side note, External Keyboard Helper _(which I can't use to remap keys, since it completely borks Alt keys in Termux. I haven't been able to figure out why.)_ has one right idea: It is supposed to be capable of only reinterpreting keys if they come from an input device with an ID that is higher than a certain threshold. Hardware keys on the device itself typically come first, so you can have the back key on the device and the escape key on the keyboard at the same time. Could this possibly be implemented for the 'escape' setting in `termux.properties`?

termux/termux-app,open,,Install packages to /system [feature request],"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"This may be a simple question, but since the installer is within the app, I figured I should ask it here. Termux is a wonderful app, and I use it almost on a daily basis. However, so often times I prefer to use the packages it provide from adb to manage my phone, and debug my own scripts and apps. I also prefer to use some other Terminal Emulator apps with Termux packages, rather than its own emulator. This is due to many reasons, such as being used to them, having more ready plugins, supporting tabs and easy style configuring.

I always use the solution provided [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/77) to do so, however I think this process could be more easy, and robust if other people use Termux with their own Terminal emulators.

My purpose is that Termux Installer should provide a way to install its binaries to the /system/bin or /system/xbin, if the device is rooted. Also, it needs to either install the libraries in the proper /system directory, and/or add the binary and library directories to the PATH so that using termux outside its emulator could be as easy typing `tmux` in the console.

Of course, installing to the /system should _not_ be enabled by default, and it should be done so only if the device has root access, and the user chooses to do so.

Please consider adding this, I think install the bin files to the /system/bin directory will be both useful, and make more sense to Linux devs. :)

termux/termux-app,open,,Termux is randomly closing / loosing sessions,"[Label(name=""bug report"")]",0,"Hi, this has been talked about on #termux quite a bit, a while ago. But I'm opening an issue here, because it still affects me (on 3 different phones) and so it doesn't get forgotten and because it is quite severe. 

On my phones, Termux would randomly close. This happens mostly in the middle of the night (on 2 out of 3 nights), but it has also happened multiple times while I was working with it over SSH. 
## Possible causes
### FolderSync

At night my phone is running a few [FolderSync](http://www.tacit.dk/foldersync) tasks. There aren't a lot of files to be synced, but it does check a lot of files. I've checked and FolderSync isn't using up Memory or CPU. 
### Jekyll

In the cases of it closing while I'm working with it, it has happened noticably more frequent when working with Jekyll, while Jekyll is generating the website.  
## Speculation

It seems to happen during times of high filesystem activity. Is it maybe related to a filesystem interrupt? Like a file that needs to be read by the app which it can't do because the filesystem is overloaded?

All this happens with or without Wakelock held. Termux isn't entirely closing, it just seems to loose the session. The following screenshot shows ""0 terminal sessions"" and the Wakelock isn't held. As far as I know, Termux should only show 0 Sessions when a Wakelock is held.

I also once made termux do a continous logcat until it closed. https://gist.github.com/Neo-Oli/faa32ecb939c1f88cbcd7748a8377600

So far, this has only happened on marhmallow phones. It first appeared the day after I upgraded from KitKat.

Sadly, I can't produce a reproducible test case that doesn't involve waiting for 12 hours. I'm hoping someone else has the same issue as me. I'd be willing to run any test builds or do any debugging I can.

The obvious approach, of doing `git init` or `git clone` in `/sdcard` fails with:
`error: chmod on /storage/emulated/0/reponame/.git/config.lock failed: Operation not permitted`
(see https://plus.google.com/+LarsStokholm/posts/eZqMLNmKX1n and similar issue https://github.com/corbinlc/gnuroot/issues/55). It would be great to find a workaround for that, but it seems tricky.

So instead, how about making Termux's app-private storage available to other apps via a Storage Access Framework DocumentsProvider? For example with [Turbo Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maskyn.fileeditor) you can enable ""Use the Storage Access Framework"" from the right hand drawer, and then it uses the SAF to open files, and can subsequently save them to the same location. Not quite as flexible as making files available via the sdcard, but perhaps better than nothing?

Google's keyboard lacks too many modifier, function, and arrow keys to be useful on a cli app like Termux. I have the hacker's keyboard set, and it works in all other apps; with the exception of Termux.

I am sorry for not reporting this sooner, but I've been setting up a new laptop. I am running on a 1st gen N7 rooted w/ cyanogenMod. 

I updated Termux/packages on an Identical N7 except 4 it's stock rooted, w/o the styling app; and it's Termux still picks up the Hacker's Keyboard just fine.

I am going to try w/o the styling app, and see if that helps. I might also try wiping the app cache 4 Termux. If these steps fail I will try a backup/reinstall of Termux.

I'll report back if anything I can come up w/ works.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/105143408064070053742/posts/SckNbhF6RQY
I was busy with other stuffs so I had made a quick post there hoping someone would chime in..  great to know that issues I wanted to report with C++ linking and play-audio have been resolved already.

Anyways back to current issue, programs that write a lot of output to terminal freezes app. I investigated it a bit and it doesnt happen if the write is limited..

Here's a test case..
Run a program that writes to terminal
`find $PREFIX/lib`
The terminal will output until a new line and freeze until the command completes.

Now limit the output with pv.
`apt install pv`
 `find $PREFIX/lib | pv -L 2048`
The output will be scrolled too fast to read in the terminal but it doesnt freeze the app.

termux/termux-app,open,,Add support for mouse gestures. ,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]",0,"In certain programs you can use mouse gestures to do various tasks, for example:
- tmux lets you resize panes with click and drag.
- weechat has swipe left and right gestures to switch buffer. 

This works when connecting to termux via SSH from a computer with mouse but it does not work when using the termux app. 
I realize that this would cause a conflict with the swipe to scroll feature, but maybe we can come up with a solution that can incorporate both these features. 
Some ways I came up with: 
- Move the long press menu into the left side drawer and have long press function as a click and drag. 
- Have a switch (or one time function like select) in the long press menu to switch between click and drag and scroll. In the two programs I came across with mouse dragging it is not something you have to do all the time, so having an additional step between might not be that bad. 

Maybe someone has a better idea?

termux/termux-app,closed,2015-12-11 23:10:07,Escape sequence for scrolling down broken with a top scroll margin,[],0,"The Termux implementation of the `${CSI}${N}T` escape sequence to scroll down N lines ([SD - Pan Up](http://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/SD)) does not take the top margin into account when figuring out where to place the scrolled rows.

A simple shell script to reproduce the issue

```
clear
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do printf ""${i}\r\n""; done
printf ""\033[3r"" # Top scroll margin to 3.
printf ""\033[2T"" # Scroll down.
read
reset
```

This should leave the screen containing

```
1
2


3
4
5
```

due to the scroll margin protecting the top two lines.

One program that is affected is `htop`, which (with a long enough list of processes relative to the terminal) sets the top margin to protect the upper CPU usage area before scrolling the list below, causing garbled display in Termux. This was reported in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/86.

I have recently (naturally) aquired a Pixel C with the Pixel C Keyboard. Almost everything seems to be working, there is just an annoyance preventing me from using termux fully.
Since they Pixel C Keyboard is missing keys, there are build-in [hotkeys](https://support.google.com/pixel/answer/6326992?hl=en) for the missing ones. However:

If I press the ![...](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FS30qf3hlMsphqXMswSDwRgvOnHTBOG0Tnip2Gb5hnNOvW6VkKf8u6jL1zJBmMG8vvJi=w18-rwa)+1 key that maps to escape I _also_ get the extended-keys soft-keyboard. It makes vi quite frustrating to use :)

I believe this is an issue with termux because:
- other programs I tried to not have this behaviour
- termux does not have this behavour with other keys like [ or ] that are also not present as physical keys.
- escape keys are funny with terminals :)
